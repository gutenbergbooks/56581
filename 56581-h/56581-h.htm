<h2>Dandiacal</h2>

<p>What a delightful fellow is your complete
dandy. No mere clothes’ prop he, the coat
does not make the dandy; no mere <i lang="fr">flâneur</i> in
fine garments; far more than that is our true
dandy.</p>

<p>Though there is not any authority for
making the statement, we do not think that
we are wrong in asserting that on the day
when Adam first complained to Eve that she
had not cut his fig-leaf breeches according to
the latest fashion dandyism was born. It is
not dead yet, only moribund, palsied, shaking
and decrepit with old age, blown upon by an
over-practical world of money-spinners and
money-spenders. Joy seems to have become
a thing of which it is necessary to go in pursuit;
in the golden days of the dandies it was a
good comrade which came almost without hailing
to those who desired its company. A real
dandy would wither and wilt in a world where
joy is so much of a stranger as it is now to
most folk.</p>

<p>It is curious that there does not exist any
history of the Rise, Decline and Fall of Dandyism,
a subject fit for the pen of Gibbon. But
the reason is, that to write it with anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
approaching to accuracy and completeness, or
with sufficient sympathy and insight, would
stagger the painstaking pedantry of a German
philosopher and tax the wit and wisdom of
George Meredith. Perhaps some day the University
of Oxford or of Cambridge, when it
has finished trifling with ponderous records of
kings and queens, of statesmen and soldiers,
of men of science and of writers of books, will
gather together a happy band of scholars and
men of the world, and will issue to us a joint-stock
history of Dandyism. Reform is in the
University air; let us hope. Might not the
Academic authorities go even further with
profit to themselves and to the nation? Ought
they not to found and well endow a Chair of
Dandyism? Should there not be a Professor
of Dandyism to teach the young idea how to
distinguish between dress and mere clothes?
Between those two there is as great a gulf
fixed as between the gentle art of the <i lang="fr">gourmet</i>
and the mere feeding of the <i lang="fr">gourmand</i>. To
teach also the art of living and the history of
dandies and of dandyism? In these prosaic
days we are only too ready to learn how to
obtain the means of living without acquiring
also a knowledge of how to use those means
to good purpose. The Universities should
likewise institute scholarships of dandyism, to
encourage the study of dandyism in our Public
and Board Schools, in both of which it is so
grossly neglected. These scholarships must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
be of meagre twenties and thirties of pounds,
but of several hundreds per annum, so as to
enable the scholar to practise the arts that he
studies. We commend this outlet for money
to millionaires of a practical turn of mind. The
future happiness of our race depends upon its
dandyism.</p>

<p>The dandy has played a conspicuous part
upon the stage of history: Alcibiades, Marc
Antony, Buckingham, Claude Duval, Benjamin
Disraeli prove the truth of this statement. It
would be a nice point to decide how far their
dandyism was part and parcel of their equipment
for attaining greatness. At one period of
English history the whole population of the
country was divided between dandies and anti-dandies,
Cavaliers and Puritans, the former
dandified in dress, religion, methods of fighting
and in morals. They were great dandies those
martial Cavaliers, and so were a few of their
successors, who flirted and frivoled at Whitehall
under Charles II.</p>

<p>The literature of dandyism is varied, vast
and interesting, but space forbids our doing
more than briefly alluding to two of its lighter
branches in English letters. The drama—or
rather the comedy—of dandyism holds a very
high place in the history of the British Stage.
Lyly, the Euphuist, was a literary dandy of
the first water, and his euphuism the height
of dandyism in literary style. Shakespeare in
<cite>Love’s Labour Lost</cite> has given us a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
comedy of dandyism, and in Mercutio a portrait
of the complete Elizabethan dandy. But the
comedy of dandyism was at its zenith in the
days of Charles II. Congreve and Wycherley
were its high priests, who preached through the
mouths of their brilliant puppets the gospel of
joy which the Court so ably practised. We
have in <cite>The School for Scandal</cite> another bright
flash of dandyism, though Charles Surface has
too much heart for a true and perfect dandy.</p>

<p>In fiction we have many striking examples
of dandiacal literature, notably <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> and
<cite>Pelham</cite>, both written by dandies.</p>

<p>Dandies vary in kind as well as in degree,
there being some who play at dandyism in
the days of their youth, such for example as
Disraeli; others who are pinchbeck dandies,
falling into the slough of overdressing, such
for example as Charles Dickens, who was a
mere colourist in garments. There are the born
dandies, Brummel, D’Orsay, George Bernard
Shaw for examples, the last of whom was born
at least 200 years behind his time; he would
have been delightful at the Court of Charles
the Merry. It is not necessary to be in the
fashion to achieve the dignity of dandyism;
G. B. S. sets the fashion himself and is the
only one who can follow it.</p>

<p>The psychology of the dandy has been much
misunderstood, probably because it has been so
little studied. What dandies have done has
been told to us in many a biography, but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
they have been—upon that point silence reigns
almost supreme. Yet the mind of the complete
dandy is well worth plumbing. Those who
know him not will perchance advance the
theory that a man possessed of a mind cannot be
a dandy; as a matter of fact the reverse is the
truth; he must possess mind, but not a heart.</p>

<p>Even so profound a philosopher and student
of human nature—the two are seldom found in
conjunction, which accounts for the inefficacy
of most philosophy—as Professor Teufelsdröckh
of Weissnichtwo has defined a dandy as “a
Clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office
and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes.
Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse and
person is heroically consecrated to this one
object, the wearing of clothes wisely and well:
so that others dress to live, he lives to dress.”</p>

<p>Which proves that though undoubtedly
German philosophers know most things in
Heaven and on Earth they do not know all,
though they themselves would never make this
admission. Teufelsdröckh’s definition of a dandy
is preposterously incomplete, showing that he
did not possess insight into the heart and soul
of dandyism. He perceived the clothes, but
not the man.</p>

<p>The proper wearing of proper clothes is but
part of the whole duty of a dandy-man. A
complete dandy is dandified in all his modes of
life; his sense of honour and his conceptions
of morality are dandified; he is an epicure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
all the arts of fine living, in all forms of fashionable
and expensive amusement, in all luxurious
accomplishments. He must be endowed with
wit, or at least gifted with a tongue of sprightliness
sufficient to pass muster as witty. He must
be perfect in the amiable art of polite conversation
and expert in the language of love.
He must own “the courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s
eye, tongue, sword”; he must be “the glass of
fashion and the mould of form, the observed of
all observers.”</p>

<p>How far did D’Orsay fulfil these requirements?
It is the aim of the following pages to
answer that question.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h1>D’Orsay</h1>

<h2 id="I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">JOCUND YOUTH</span></h2>

<p>It is the habit of historians to pay little heed to
the childhood and the training of the kings, conquerors,
statesmen and the other big folk whose
achievements they record and whose characters
they seldom fathom or portray. But perhaps they
are right just as perhaps sometimes they are
accurate. It is easier to judge correctly and
with understanding the boy and what really were
the influences that affected his development,
when we know the performances of his maturity,
than it is to trace in the child the father of the
man. By what the man was we may know what
the boy had been. Which brings us to this point,
that we need not very deeply regret that the
records of D’Orsay’s early years are but scanty.
Such as they are they suffice to give us all that
we require—a fugitive glimpse here and there
of a childhood as great in promise as the manhood
was in performance.</p>

<p>Gédéon Gaspard Alfred de Grimaud, Count
d’Orsay and du Saint-Empire, Prince of Dandies,
was born upon the 4th of September, in the year
1801. Whether or not he came into the world
under the influence of a lucky star we can find
no record; upon that point each of us may draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
his own conclusion in accordance with his judgment
of D’Orsay’s career and character.</p>

<p>He sprang from a noble and distinguished
family, his father Albert, Count d’Orsay, being
a soldier of the Empire and accepted as one of
the handsomest men of his day, Napoleon saying
of him that he was “<i lang="fr">aussi brave que beau</i>.” It
has been written of the son, “Il est le fils d’un
général de nos armées héroiques, aussi célèbre
par sa beauté que par ses faits d’armes.” Alfred
inherited his father’s good looks and his accomplishment
with the sword.</p>

<p>Writing in 1828, Lady Blessington says:
“General d’Orsay, known from his youth as Le
Beau d’Orsay, still justifies the appellation, for he
is the handsomest man of his age that I have
ever beheld…;” and Lady Blessington was an
experienced judge of manly beauty.</p>

<p>His mother, a beautiful woman, was Eléanore,
Baroness de Franquemont, a daughter of the
King of Würtemberg by his marriage with
Madame Crawford, also needless to say a beautiful
woman; also apparently dowered handsomely
with wit and worldly wisdom. Her
marriage with the King who, it has been neatly
said, “baptised with French names his dogs,
his castles and his bastards,” was of course a
left-handed affair, and on his right-handedly marrying
within his own rank, she retired in dudgeon
to France. Later she married an Irishman of
large means, a Mr O’Sullivan, with whom she
resided for some time in India, surviving him
and dying at the advanced age of eighty-four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
full of youthfulness and ardour. The grandson
inherited her accomplishment in love.</p>

<p>So alluring, indeed, were her charms, that
on her return from the East one of her many
admirers presented her with a bottle of otto of
Roses, outdone in sweetness by the following
Mooreish compliment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Quand la ‘belle Sullivan’ quitta l’Asie,</div>
<div class="verse">La Rose, amoureuse de ses charmes,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleura le départ de sa belle amie,</div>
<div class="verse">Et ce flacon contient ses larmes.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fragrance of the otto has long departed
but that of the compliment remains. A pretty
compliment deserves to attain immortality.</p>

<p>When in Paris in 1828 Lady Blessington
was upon terms of intimacy with the D’Orsays,
and was greatly impressed by <i lang="fr">la belle Sullivan</i>,
or, as she preferred to be called, Madame Crawford.
She visited her in a charming hôtel,
“<i lang="fr">entre Cour et Jardin</i>”; and decided that she
was the most “exquisite person of her age”
that she had ever seen. She was then in her
eightieth year, but we are told that she did
not look more than fifty-five, and was full of
good-humour and vivacity. “Scrupulously exact
in her person, and dressed with the utmost care
as well as good taste, she gives me a notion of
the appearance which the celebrated Ninon de
l’Enclos must have presented at the same age,
and has much of the charm of manner said to
have belonged to that remarkable woman.”</p>

<p>There is considerable mystery about this good
lady’s career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a foregone conclusion that a woman
of this style would dote upon and do her best
endeavour to spoil a bright, handsome boy such
as was her grandson Alfred. Being an only son,
an elder brother having died in infancy, the child
was made much of on all sides. His good looks,
his smartness, even his early developed taste for
extravagant luxuries, charmed his accomplished
grandmother, whom when later on he entered the
army we find presenting him with a magnificent
service of plate, which brought upon him more
ridicule than envy from his brother officers.</p>

<p>In 1815 Paris was in a ferment of excitements
and entertainments, all the great men and many
of the great ladies of Europe were there gathered
together—where the spoil is there shall the
vultures be gathered together. Young D’Orsay,
mere lad though he was, came very much to
the front; even thus early his immaculate dress
was noticeable; his spirited English hunter and
his superb horsemanship attracted attention.
Though he probably did not particularly relish
the occurrence, he was presented to the Duke
of Wellington. A great meeting this, the conqueror
of the men of France and the future
conqueror of the women of England.</p>

<p>Lord William Pitt Lennox, himself only sixteen,
relates that he met D’Orsay in Paris in
1814, and he goes on to state that “in the hours
of recreation, he showed me all the sights of the
‘City of Frivolity,’ as Paris has been not inaptly
named.” Pretty good for two such mere lads!</p>

<p>“One of our first visits was to the Café des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Milles Colonnes, which was, at the period I
write of, the most attractive café in Paris. Large
as it was, it was scarcely capable of containing
the vast crowds who besieged it every evening,
to admire its saloons decorated with unprecedented
magnificence.…</p>

<p>“Wellington had a private box at the Théâtre
Français, which D’Orsay and myself constantly
occupied to witness the splendid acting of Talma,
Madame Georges, Mademoiselle Duchesnois in
tragedy, and of that daughter of Nature, Mademoiselle
Mars, in comedy.…</p>

<p>“Upon witnessing Perlet in <cite lang="fr">Le Comédien
d’Etampes</cite>, D’Orsay said—</p>

<p>“‘Is not Perlet <em>superlative</em>?’”</p>

<p>In another of his numerous voluminous and
often highly entertaining memoirs, Lord William
writes of this same visit to Paris:—</p>

<p>“One youth attracted great attention that
day”—it was a royal hunt in the Bois de
Boulogne—“from his handsome appearance, his
gentlemanlike bearing, his faultless dress and
the splendid English hunter he was mounted
upon. This was Count Alfred d’Orsay, afterwards
so well known in London society. De
Grammont,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who some few years after married
his sister, had sent him from England a first-rate
Leicestershire hunter, whose fine shape,
simple saddle and bridle contrasted favourably
with the heavy animals and smart caparisons
then in fashion with the Parisian Nimrods.</p>

<p>“The Count was presented to Wellington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and his staff, and from that moment he became
a constant guest at the Hôtel Borghese.…”</p>

<p>Of another hunt, or rather of the return from
it, we read:—</p>

<p>“Nothing occurred during the day’s sport to
merit any particular comment; perhaps the most
amusing part of it was our ‘lark’ home across
the country, when myself, Fremantle, and other
<i lang="fr">attachés</i> of the English Embassy, led some half
dozen Frenchmen a rather stiffish line of stone
walls and brooks. Among the latter was
D’Orsay, who, albeit unaccustomed to go ‘across
country,’ was always in the ‘first flight,’ making
up by hard riding whatever he may have
lacked in judgment; he afterwards lived to be an
excellent sportsman and a good rider to hounds.”</p>

<p>As became the son of his father, though
scarcely fitting in the grandson of a king, D’Orsay
was ever a staunch Bonapartist, feeling the full
strength of the glamour of Napoleon. But the
Emperor and the Empire vanished in cannon
smoke; the Bourbons occupied rather uncomfortably
the throne of France, and D’Orsay, much
against the grain, entered the King’s <i lang="fr">garde-du-corps</i>.
But so ardent was his devotion to Bonapartism,
that when the new monarch made his
state entry into his capital, the lad refused to be a
witness of his triumph, would not add his voice
to the general acclamation, and indulged in the
luxury of tears in a back room.</p>

<p>His inherited instincts and his education gave
him a taste for all the fine arts of life, and Nature
endowed him with exceptionally good looks. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
upstanding man he became, over six feet in
stature; broad-shouldered and slim-waisted;
hands and feet of unusual beauty; long, curly,
dark chestnut hair; forehead high and wide; lips
rather full; eyes large, and light hazel in colour.
Though there was something almost femininely
soft about his beauty he was nowise effeminate;
in fact, he was a superb athlete, and highly skilled
in almost every form of manly exercise and sport.
We are told that he was a wit; a capital companion
at all hours of the day and night; a quite
capable amateur artist, who, as is the way of
amateurs, received assistance from his professional
friends, and—which is unusual at any rate among
amateurs in art if not in sport—took pay for his
work. In short, he was a very highly-gifted and
accomplished young man.</p>

<p>D’Orsay was born in an age when the atmosphere
was electric with adventure; when nobodies
rapidly became somebodies, and many who had
been brought up to consider themselves very
considerable somebodies were shocked at being
told that in truth they were nobodies, or at
best but the thin shadows of great names. It
was an age when even the discomforts of a
throne were not an unreasonable aspiration for
the most humbly born. With his beauty of
face and figure, fascinating manners and high
family influence, young D’Orsay must have looked
upon the world as a fine fat oyster which he could
easily open and from which he could pluck the
pearl of success. He possessed a winning tongue
that would have made him a great diplomat; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
daring and skill at arms that would have stood
him in good stead as a soldier of fortune; a power
of raising money in most desperate straits that
would have rendered him an unrivalled minister
of finance. From all these roads to distinction he
turned aside; he was born to a greater fate; his was
the genius of a complete dandy. Few great men
have been able so justly to appraise their abilities;
still fewer to attain so surely their ambition.</p>

<p>During his short service in the army he proved
himself a good officer and made himself popular
with his men by looking to their comfort and welfare.
Naturally he assumed the lead in all the
gaieties of the garrison town, the assemblies, the
dances, the dinners, the promenadings, but how
petty they must have been to him, and how often
he must have wistfully repined for Paris. He
could not play his great part on so circumscribed
a stage and with so poor a company of players.
But if he could not find sufficient social sport, he
could fight, and did. On one occasion the cause
of the duel was noteworthy. It happened only a
few days after he had joined his regiment that at
mess one of his brother officers made use of an
offensive expression in connection with the name
of the Blessed Virgin. D’Orsay, as became a
devout Catholic gentleman, expostulated. The
offence was offensively repeated, upon which
D’Orsay, evidently feeling that a verbal retort
would not suffice to meet the gravity of the
occasion, threw a plateful of spinach in the face
of the transgressor. Thereupon a challenge and
a duel fought that evening upon the town ramparts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
With what result? Alas, as so often upon important
affairs, history holds her tongue. The
historic muse is an arrant jade, who chatters unceasingly
upon matters of no moment, and is
silent upon points concerning which we thirst for
information. That is one of the ways of women.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a later duel, D’Orsay remarked
to his second before the encounter:—</p>

<p>“You know, my dear friend, I am not on a
par with my antagonist; he is a very ugly
fellow, and if I wound him in the face he won’t
look much the worse for it; but on my side it
ought to be agreed that he should not aim
higher than my chest, for if my face should be
spoiled <i lang="fr">ce serait vraiment dommage</i>.”</p>

<p>A dandy with a damaged nose or deprived
of one eye would be a figure of fun.</p>

<p>From remote ancestors D’Orsay inherited
the spirit of chivalry, setting woman upon a
lofty pedestal and then asking her to step down
and make love to him. He was always ready
to rescue a woman—not merely a beauty—in
distress, of which a fine example is an event
which befell while he was living out of barracks
in apartments, which were kept by a widow,
who had one son and two daughters. The son
was a muscular young man of robust temper,
and attracted—or rather distracted—one day by
the sounds of tumult rising from below, D’Orsay
hastened downstairs to find this youth employed in
bullying his mother. The blood of D’Orsay was
inflamed; the dandy thrashed the lout, promising
still heavier punishment should occasion arise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">SHE</span></h2>

<p>Even the ardent D’Orsay, while he was thus preparing
himself for his life-work and laying the
foundation upon which he was to raise so superb
a fame, could not in the hours of his highest inspiration
have dreamed that Fate was deciding
his future in the person of a lovely Irish peeress,
the cynosure of London society. Such, in fact,
was the case. In the year 1821 he visited
England and met with the woman who held his
fortunes in her beautiful arms.</p>

<p>Margaret, or as she preferred to be called,
and when a lady expresses a preference that
should suffice, Marguerite Power was born at
Knockbrit, near Clonmel, on the 1st of September
1789, being the third of the six children of
Edmund Power, a Tipperary squireen of extravagant
propensities and of a violent temper
and overbearing tyranny which rendered him a
curse to his family. He was a good-looking,
swaggering fellow, with a showy air, fond of
fine clothes, fine wine, fine horses, and various
other fine things, indulgence in which his income
did not justify. His were a handsome set of
children: the two sons, Michael and Robert,
attained the army rank of captain; Marguerite—and
two sisters, Ellen and Mary Anne; the
eldest child died young. Of a quieter disposition
than her brothers and sisters, Marguerite as a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was rather weak and ailing, sensitive and reflective.
At that time of her life her beauty was not obvious;
indeed few then seem to have realised that
there was any charm in the soft, round, clear-complexioned
face, with its pretty dimples and large,
grey eyes shielded by long, drooping lashes. Her
voice was low, soft, caressing; her movements
unstudiedly graceful. A dreamy child, who lived in
fancy-land; strange to her comrades, who awarded
her little else than ridicule and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>In 1796 the Powers moved into Clonmel, which
change was welcomed by all the family save
Marguerite, who looked forward to it with a
foreboding that was only too fully fulfilled. In
some ways this move wrought good for the child,
awakening her to the realities of life, arousing an
interest in the ways and doings of the society into
which she was thrown; her health improved, and
with it her spirits, both mental and physical.</p>

<p>Her father’s pecuniary affairs now went
rapidly from worse to much worse, and his
adventures in politics rendered him highly unpopular
with those of his own rank and station. He
was a hospitable soul in his reckless, feckless way
while he had a penny to spend, and often when
he had not, filling his house with guests, many of
whom were military men, and emptying his purse.</p>

<p>When only fifteen years old Marguerite began
to go out into society, as did her sister Ellen, her
junior by more than a year. The rackety society
of a small, Irish garrison town can scarcely have
been wholesome for a young, impressionable girl,
and to its influence may be attributed the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in Lady Blessington’s character of many evil
traits which healthful surroundings and judicious
restraint might have held in check. The two
graceful, pretty children quickly became popular.</p>

<p>Among the familiar guests at the father’s
house in 1804 were two officers of the 47th
Regiment of Foot, then stationed in Clonmel,
Captain Murray and Captain Maurice St Leger
Farmer, the latter a man of considerable means,
which was quite sufficient in Power’s eyes to
make him an excellent match for Marguerite, to
whom both the officers were paying attention.
Though Farmer was young, good-looking,
plausible, the child’s fancy turned toward his
rival, who wooed and would have won her had
a fair field been granted him. He warned
Marguerite that Farmer had proposed for her
hand to her father, the news coming to her
entirely unexpected, most unwelcome, difficult to
credit. But in a few days the information was
proved conclusively to be true, her father informing
her that Farmer had approached him in
the matter, and that he had given his cordial
consent to his addresses. Marguerite was
dismayed, at first stunned. She fully understood
the strong inducements which the prospect
of her marriage with Farmer had for a man in
her father’s embarrassed circumstances, and knew
only too well from bitter experience how intolerant
he was of opposition to any of his whims or
wishes, and how little weight the desires of any of
his children bore with him. From her mother she
expected some sympathy, but to her dismay received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
scant consideration for her plea to be spared,
her unwillingness being counted the romantic
notion of a child too young to be able to form
a right judgment of the advantages offered by
this proposed marriage. Tears and entreaties
availed not, and the child was married to a man
whom she held in detestation and in fear.</p>

<p>That the outcome of this inhuman mating was
misery is not wonderful; there was not in it any
possibility of happiness. The one a very turbulent
man who, though not actually insane, was subject to
paroxysms of rage that were terrifying; the other
a child not yet sixteen years of age, with a nature
very sensitive, impressionable, and with that intense
longing for love, sympathy and understanding
so common among Irish women and men. We
know what Marguerite Power did become; it is idle
to conjecture what she might have been had not
this abominable marriage been thrust upon her.</p>

<p>From her own account, which seems trustworthy,
we learn that her husband treated his child-wife
outrageously, not even refraining from physical
violence. Her arms were meanly pinched till black
and blue; her face struck. When he went abroad, not
infrequently he would lock her into her room, sometimes
leaving her for hours without nourishment.</p>

<p>Three months after their marriage Farmer was
ordered to rejoin his regiment at Kildare, and his
wife took the bold, determined step of refusing to
go with him. A separation being arranged, Marguerite
returned to her father’s house, where she
received a welcome the reverse of kind. Home
was made utterly distasteful to her, and sympathy—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one thing that might have saved her—was withheld
by her father and mother. It was given to her
from an alien quarter, and she accepted the “protection”
offered to her by Captain Thomas Jenkins
of the 11th Light Dragoons, a Hampshire man of
considerable property. The astonishing thing is that
she acted on the advice given to her by Major, afterwards
Sir Edward Blakeney, her supposed friend
and well-wisher. Meanwhile Farmer had gone
out to India in the East India Company’s service.</p>

<p>When Lord Mountjoy, better known as Lord
Blessington, first met with the fascinating Marguerite
is not quite clear, but in all probability
he did so in or about 1804, when serving as
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tyrone Militia when
stationed at Clonmel.</p>

<p>Blessington plays a considerable and mysterious
part in the life of D’Orsay. His father, the
Right Hon. Luke Gardiner, was born in the year
1745, and did his duty by his country and possibly
by his conscience in various ways. He
married the daughter of a Scotch baronet, who
presented him with several daughters and two
sons, one of these latter dying in infancy, the
other, Charles John, entering the world on July 19,
1782. He was educated at Eton and at Christ
Church, Oxford, and succeeded his father in the
titles of Viscount and Baron Mountjoy in 1798.
In 1809 he was elected, upon what qualifications it
is difficult to imagine, a representative peer of
Ireland, and in 1816 was created Earl of Blessington.
In this same year we hear of his visiting
Marguerite in Manchester Square, London.</p>

<p>As far as wealth was concerned Blessington certainly
was granted a fine start in life, but it may
well be doubted if he were well endowed or endowed
at all with brains of any value, though we are informed
by a lukewarm but still possibly too warm
biographer that he was “possessed of some talents.”
Let us hope so; but if so, he contrived with great
skill to bury them. We do hear of him speaking
in the House of Lords in support of a motion for
a vote of thanks to Lord Wellington, and as a
specimen of his eloquence we quote:—</p>

<p>“No general was better skilled in war, none
more enlightened than Lord Viscount Wellington.
The choice of a position at Talavera reflected lustre
on his talents; the victory was as brilliant and as
glorious as any on record. It was entitled to the
unanimous approbation of their lordships, and the
eternal gratitude of Spain and of this country.”</p>

<p>It is also recorded that his lordship spoke but
seldom, which may be counted to him for a saving
grace.</p>

<p>He seems to have been more at home in the
green-room than in the neighbourhood of the
woolsack. He was very wealthy, very prodigal,
vastly futile. Byron relates of him:—“Mountjoy
… seems very good-natured, but is much
tamed since I recollect him in all the glory
of gems and snuff-boxes, and uniforms and
theatricals, sitting to Strolling, the painter, to be
depicted as one of the heroes of Agincourt.”</p>

<p>In another portrait he appears as Achilles,
dragging at his chariot-tail the body of Hector, a
friend “sitting” for the corpse. Physically he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
vigorous; a tall, bright-looking man; a capital
companion, when only good spirits and a strong
head unadorned with brain-sauce were called for.</p>

<p>In 1808, or 1809, Blessington—then mere
Mountjoy—fell in with a very charming and
well-favoured lady named Brown, but there were
“some difficulties in the way of the resolution
he had formed of marrying the lady, but the
obstacles were removed.” The obstacle was the
mere trifle of her already being possessed of if not
blessed with a husband, Major Brown, who, however,
discreetly and considerately departed this life
in 1812, thus enabling Blessington to legalise the
lady’s position in his establishment, the outcome of
his connection with her having already been that
she had borne him two children, Charles John and
Emilie Rosalie. This lady subsequently presented
him with two further pledges of her fond affection,
Lady Harriet Anne Frances Gardiner, born in
1812, and Luke Wellington, afterwards by courtesy
Viscount Mountjoy, born in 1814. On the
9th of September of this same year she died.</p>

<p>Blessington was gifted with a penchant for
losing his heart to ladies possessed of “obstacles”
in the way of his complete happiness, for, as
has been noted, he was in 1816 <i lang="la">vice</i> Jenkins
befriending Marguerite Farmer. Again fortune
smiled on his desires, Farmer dying of injuries
received during a drunken frolic in October 1817.
On 16th February of the following year his
widow became Lady Blessington, she then being
in her twenty-ninth, he in his thirty-seventh, year.</p>

<p>Her beauty had ripened into something near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
akin to perfection, a bright and radiant spirit
shining through the physical tenement. Hers
was a vivid, compelling loveliness, supported by
a vivacious good humour. Her figure, though
somewhat tending toward over-fullness, was
moulded on exquisite lines and of almost perfect
proportions; her movements still graceful and
free, as they had been when she was a child;
her face—now pensively lovely, now suddenly
illuminated with a joyous fancy that first expressed
itself in her sparkling eyes; pouting lips;
a clear, sweet-toned voice; the merriest of merry
laughs. In sober truth, a very fascinating woman.</p>

<p>This wild Irish girl, for certainly she had been a
<em>leetle</em> wild, had climbed high up the social ladder.
Without any other fortune than her face and her
winsome ways she had won a peer for her lord,
who if not highly endowed with ability possessed
fortune in abundance, which for the purposes of
her contentment was even more to be desired.</p>

<p>The fond pair paid a visit to my lord’s estate
in County Tyrone, and also to Dublin, where the
appearance of my lady created no small stir.
From the first day of their marriage Blessington
exhibited a sumptuous extravagance in providing
luxuries for Lady Blessington, who herself
records:—“The only complaint I ever have to
make of his taste, is its too great splendour; a
proof of which he gave me when I went to
Mountjoy Forest on my marriage, and found my
private sitting-room hung with crimson Genoa
silk velvet, trimmed with gold bullion fringe, and
all the furniture of equal richness—a richness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was only suited to a state-room in a palace,” or to
any other room seldom used or seen.</p>

<p>The wilds of Ireland, however, were not a
fitting stage for one so ambitious to charm as
was Lady Blessington, so after a short sojourn
in Tyrone she and her husband returned to
London, where they took up their residence at
10 St James’ Square, a house that had been
dignified by the occupancy of Chatham and was
to be by that of Gladstone.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was as blest as was to be
the Duke of Leeds’ bride, of whom the rhyme
ran:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She shall have all that’s fine and fair,</div>
<div class="verse">And the best of silk and satin shall wear;</div>
<div class="verse">And ride in a coach to take the air,</div>
<div class="verse">And have a house in St James’ Square.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mansion was fitted and furnished in a
style that only great wealth could afford or ill
taste admire.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington with her “gorgeous charms”
set the one-half of London society raving about
her beauty and her extravagance; the other
half avoided the company of a lady with so
speckled a past.</p>

<p>There were at that time two great <i lang="fr">salons</i> in
London: the one at Holland House to which
wit, beauty and respectability resorted; the
second being at Lady Blessington’s house, to
which only wit and beauty were attracted.
Among the constant visitors to the latter may
be named Canning, Castlereagh, who lived a
few doors off; Brougham, Jekyll, Rogers, Moore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Kemble, Mathews the elder, Lawrence, Wilkie.
Moore records a visit paid by him in May 1822,
accompanied by Washington Irving. He speaks
of Lady Blessington as growing “very absurd.”</p>

<p>“I have felt very melancholy and ill all this
day,” she said.</p>

<p>“Why is that?” Moore asked, doubtless
with becoming sympathy in his voice and
manner.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It is the anniversary of my poor Napoleon’s
death.”</p>

<p>Joseph Jekyll, who was well known in society
as a wit and teller of good stories and to his
family as a writer of capital letters, was born
in 1754, dying in 1837. It is quite startling to
find him writing casually in 1829 of having
talked with “Dr” Goldsmith; how close this
brings long past times; there are those alive
who met D’Orsay, who in turn knew Jekyll, who
talked with Goldsmith. Jerdan speaks of Jekyll
as having “a somewhat Voltaire-like countenance,
and a flexible person and agreeable voice.”</p>

<p>He was a great hand at dining-out, though
it distressed him to meet other old folk, whom
he unkindly dubbed “Methusalems.”</p>

<p>In November 1821, he writes: “London still
dreary enough; but I have dinners with judges
and lawyers—nay, yesterday with the divine
bit of blue, Lady Blessington and her comical
Earl. I made love and Mathews (the elder)
was invited to make faces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the February of the succeeding year,
he records another visit to St James’ Square:—</p>

<p>“London is by no means yet a desert. Lately
we had a grand dinner at Lord Blessington’s,
who has transmogrified Sir T. Heathcote’s
ground floor into a vast apartment, and bedizened
it with black and gold like an enormous
coffin. We had the Speaker, Lord Thanet, Sir
T. Lawrence.…” etc.</p>

<p>In June 1822 we find Blessington in quite
unexpected company and engaged upon matters
that would scarcely have seemed likely to appeal
to him. On the first of that month a meeting
was held of the British and Foreign Philanthropic
Society, of which the object was “to carry into
effect measures for the permanent relief of the
labouring classes, by communities for mutual
interest and co-operation, in which, by means
of education, example and employment, they will
be gradually withdrawn from the evils induced by
ignorance, bad habits, poverty and want of employment.”
Robert Owen was the moving spirit
of the Society, and the membership was highly
distinguished, including among other unforgotten
names those of Brougham, John Galt and Sir
James Graham. At a meeting at Freemasons’
Hall, Blessington was entrusted with the reading
of a report by the committee, in which it was
recommended that communities should be established
on Owen’s wildly visionary plan. The
meeting was enthusiastic, much money was
promised, and—history does not record anything
further of the Society.</p>

<h2 id="III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">MARS AND VENUS</span></h2>

<p>In France—a youthful son of Mars; in England—Venus
at her zenith.</p>

<p>D’Orsay paid his first visit to London in
1821, as the guest of the Duc de Guiche, to
whom his sister, Ida, was married. De Guiche,
son of the Duc de Grammont, had been one of
the many “emigrants” of high family who had
sought and had found in England shelter from
the tempest of the Revolution, and had shown
his gratitude for hospitality received by serving
in the 10th Hussars during the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Landor, writing some twenty years later, says:
“The Duc de Guiche is the handsomest man I
ever saw. What poor animals other men seem
in the presence of him and D’Orsay. He is
also full of fun, of anecdote, of spirit and of
information.”</p>

<p>Gronow describes him as speaking English
perfectly, and as “quiet in manner, and a most
chivalrous, high-minded and honourable man.
His complexion was very dark, with crisp black
hair curling close to his small, well-shaped
head. His features were regular and somewhat
aquiline; his eyes, large, dark and beautiful; and
his manner, voice, and smile were considered by
the fair sex to be perfectly irresistible”; concluding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
“the most perfect gentleman I ever met with
in any country.”</p>

<p>So we may take it that D’Orsay did not feel
that he was visiting a land with which he had
not any tie of sympathy.</p>

<p>His sister Ida was a year older than himself,
or, to put it more gallantly, a year less young,
and bore to him a strong likeness in appearance
but not in disposition—fortunately for her husband.
Her good looks were supported by good sense.</p>

<p>William Archer Shee describes the Duchesse de
Guiche as “a blonde, with blue eyes, fair hair, a
majestic figure, an exquisite complexion.…”</p>

<p>In those golden days the adornment of a
handsome person with ultra-fashionable clothes
did not qualify a man as a dandy. Much more
was demanded. It was, therefore, no small
feather in D’Orsay’s cap that he came to London
an unknown young man, was seen, and by his
very rivals at once acknowledged as a conqueror.
His youth, his handsome face, his debonairness,
his wit, were irresistible. Everywhere, even at
Holland House, he made a good impression. He
rode in Hyde Park perfectly “turned out,” the
admired of those who were accustomed to receive,
not to give, admiration. At a ball at the French
Embassy where all the lights of fashionable society
shone in a brilliant galaxy, he was a centre of
attraction “with his usual escort of dandies.”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">St James’s Square in 1812</span></p>

<p class="caption-r">[TO FACE PAGE 36</p>

</div>

<p>At the Blessingtons’ he was a favoured guest.
Gronow, discreetly naming no names, writes of
the “unfortunate circumstances which entangled
the Count as with a fatal web from early youth”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
surely a poorly prosaic way of describing the
romantic love of a young man for a beautiful
woman only twelve years his senior?</p>

<p>As Grantley Berkeley puts it: “The young
Count made a most favourable impression where-ever
he appeared; but nowhere did it pierce so
deep or so lasting as in the heart of his charming
hostess of the magnificent <i lang="it">conversaziones</i>, <i lang="fr">soirées</i>,
dinners, balls, breakfasts and suppers, that followed
each other in rapid succession in that brilliant
mansion in St James’ Square.”</p>

<p>Grantley Berkeley also says: “At his first
visit to England, he was pre-eminently handsome;
and, as he dressed fashionably, was
thoroughly accomplished, and gifted with superior
intelligence, he became a favourite with both
sexes. He had the reputation of being a lady-killer
… and his pure classical features, his
accomplishments, and irreproachable get-up, were
sure to be the centre of attraction, whether in
the Park or dining-room.”</p>

<p>Then of later times: “He used to ride pretty
well to hounds, and joined the hunting men at
Melton; but his style was rather that of the
riding-school than of the hunting-field.…</p>

<p>“In dress he was more to the front; indeed,
the name of D’Orsay was attached by tailors to
any kind of raiment, till Vestris tried to turn the
Count into ridicule. Application was made to
his tailor for a coat made exactly after the
Count’s pattern. The man sent notice of it to
his patron, asking whether he should supply the
order, and the answer being in the affirmative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the garment was made and sent home. No
doubt D’Orsay imagined that some enthusiastic
admirer had in this way sought to testify his
appreciation; but, on going to the Olympic
Theatre to witness a new piece, he had the
gratification of seeing his coat worn by Liston
as a burlesque of himself.” This “take-off” did
not please D’Orsay, who withdrew his patronage
from the Olympic and appeared no more in the
green-room which he had been wont to frequent.
But the town, which had caught wind of the
joke, was delighted, and roared with merriment.</p>

<p>Is there a hidden reference to D’Orsay’s visit
and possibly even to Lady Blessington in these
lines from “Don Juan”?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At a later date we find Byron describing the
Count to Tom Moore as one “who has all the
air of a <i lang="fr">cupidon déchainé</i>, and is one of the few
specimens I have ever seen of our ideal of a
Frenchman before the Revolution.”</p>

<p>Also at that later date (1823), when he met
D’Orsay at Genoa with the Blessingtons, Byron
was lent by Blessington a journal which the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had written during this first visit of his to London.
When returning it, he writes, on 5th April:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lord</span>,—How is your gout? or
rather how are you? I return the Count
d’Orsay’s journal, which is a very extraordinary
production, and of a most melancholy truth in
all that regards high life in England. I know,
or knew personally, most of the personages and
societies which he describes; and after reading
his remarks, have the sensation fresh upon me
as if I had seen them yesterday. I would,
however, plead in behalf of some few exceptions,
which I will mention by and bye. The most
singular thing is, <em>how</em> he should have penetrated
<em>not</em> the <em>facts</em>, but the <em>mystery</em> of English <i lang="fr">ennui</i>,
at two-and-twenty.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I was about the same age
when I made the same discovery, in almost
precisely the same circles—for there is scarcely
a person whom I did not see nightly or daily,
and was acquainted more or less intimately with
most of them—but I never could have discovered
it so well, <i lang="fr">Il faut être Français</i> to effect this.
But he ought also to have seen the country
during the hunting season, with ‘a select party
of distinguished guests,’ as the papers term it.
He ought to have seen the gentlemen after
dinner (on the hunting days), and the soirée
ensuing thereupon—and the women looking as
if they had hunted, or rather been hunted; and
I could have wished that he had been at a
dinner in town, which I recollect at Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Cowper’s—small, but select, and composed of
the most amusing people.… Altogether, your
friend’s journal is a very formidable production.
Alas! our dearly-beloved countrymen have only
discovered that they are tired, and not that they
are tiresome; and I suspect that the communication
of the latter unpleasant verity will not be better
received than truths usually are. I have read the
whole with great attention and instruction—I am
too good a patriot to say <em>pleasure</em>—at least I won’t
say so, whatever I may think.… I beg that
you will thank the young philosopher.…”</p>

</div>

<p>A few days later—how pleasing it is to find
one great writer openly admiring another and a
younger!—Byron writes to D’Orsay himself:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Count d’Orsay</span> (if you will
permit me to address you so familiarly)—you
should be content with writing in your own
language, like Grammont, and succeeding in
London as nobody has succeeded since the days
of Charles the Second, and the records of Antonio
Hamilton, without deviating into our barbarous
language—which you understand and write,
however, much better than it deserves. ‘My
approbation,’ as you are pleased to term it, was
very sincere, but perhaps not very impartial; for,
though I love my country, I do not love my
countrymen—at least, such as they now are.
And besides the seduction of talent and wit in
your work, I fear that to me there was the
attraction of vengeance. I have <em>seen</em> and <em>felt</em>
much of what you have described so well …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the portraits are so like that I cannot but admire
the painter no less than his performance. But
I am sorry for you; for if you are so well acquainted
with life at your age, what will become
of you when the illusion is still more dissipated?”</p>

</div>

<p>It is much to be regretted that this vivacious
journal has never seen the light of publicity;
there must have been considerable interest in a
piece of writing which so greatly attracted and
excited the admiration of Byron; but even more
important, its pages would have helped to the
understanding of D’Orsay and have brought us
closer to him in these his young days. Further,
a view of English society at that date by a
candid Frenchman must have been highly entertaining.
D’Orsay, apparently having changed
his mind with regard to persons and things, or
fearing that the publication of so scathing an
indictment might savour of ingratitude toward
those who had entertained him with kindness,
consigned to the flames this “very formidable production”
of his ebullient days of youth. Another
account is that it was destroyed by his sister.</p>

<p>In 1822 D’Orsay tore himself away from the
enchantments of London and bade farewell to
the beautiful enchantress of St James’ Square.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PRIMROSE PATH</span></h2>

<p>In November 1822, D’Orsay again met Lady
Blessington.</p>

<p>Apparently it was at Blessington’s express
desire that the house in St James’ Square was
shut up; its glories were dimmed with holland
sheetings; the mirrors that had reflected so
much of youth and love and beauty were
covered; the windows that had so often shone
with hospitable lights were shuttered and barred.
On 25th August a start was made on a Continental
tour. Blessington was satiated with the
turmoil of pleasures that London afforded, satiety
held him in its bitter grasp. He had exhausted
the wild joys of the life of a man about town; he
was still thirsty for enjoyment, but the accustomed
draughts no longer quenched his thirst. It was
bluntly said by one that he was “prematurely
impaired in mental energies.” Whether that
were or were not the case, judging by his conduct
during the remainder of his life he must
have lost all sense of honour and of social
decency.</p>

<p>To the party of two a third member was
added in the person of Lady Blessington’s
youngest sister, Mary Anne Power, a woman
pretty in a less full-blown style than her sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which caused her to be likened to a primrose set
beside a peach blossom. Lady Blessington, who
for herself preferred Marguerite to Margaret,
renamed her sister Marianne. In 1831 Marianne
married the Comte de St Marsault, but the union
was disastrously unhappy. The Comte was an
aged gentleman of ancient lineage, and his
wintriness blighted the poor primrose.</p>

<p>The tourists travelled in great style by
Dover, Calais, Rouen, St Germain-en-Laye, and
so on to Paris. At St Germain Lady Blessington’s
thoughts naturally turned toward the unhallowed
fortunes of the La Pompadour and du
Barry. She pondered over the curious fact that
decency does in social estimation take from vice
half its sting, and over the coarseness displayed
by Louis XV. in choosing his mistresses from
outside the ranks of the ladies of his Court,
rendering the refinement of Louis XIV. virtuous
by contrast. She very truly says—and what
better judge could we wish for upon such a point
than she?—“A true morality would be disposed
to consider the courtly splendour attached to the
loves of Louis XIV. as the more demoralising
example of the two, from being the less disgusting.”</p>

<p>In Paris they halted for some days, meeting
among other distinguished men with the volatile
Tom Moore, whom Lady Blessington hits off
with the singular felicity and simplicity of
language that distinguishes her literary style.
She found him to be of “a happy temperament,
that conveys the idea of having never lived out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of sunshine, and his conversation reminds one of
the evolutions of some bird of gorgeous plumage,
each varied hue of which becomes visible as he
carelessly sports in the air.”</p>

<p>Lady Blessington’s birthday, September 1st,
was celebrated during this visit to Paris, and she
tells us that after a woman has passed the age of
thirty the recurrence of birthdays is not a matter
for congratulation, concluding with the striking
remark: “Youth is like health, we never value
the possession of either until they have begun to
decline.”</p>

<p>From Paris they went on to Switzerland.
Their travelling equipage not unnaturally aroused
the wonderment of the onlookers who assembled
to witness their departure. Travelling carriages
and a baggage wagon—a <i lang="fr">fourgon</i>—piled high
with imperials and packages of all sizes; the
courier, as important in his mien as a commander
of an army corps, bustling here, bustling there;
lady’s maid busily packing; valets and footmen
staggering and grumbling under heavy trunks.
Lady Blessington heard a Frenchman under her
window exclaim: “How strange those English
are! One would suppose that instead of a single
family, a regiment at least were about to move!”</p>

<p>Move at last the regiment did, though not
without dire struggling. They are off! Amid a
tornado of expostulations and exhortations; off
along the straight, dusty roads to Switzerland.
Further we need not accompany them. For us
the centre of interest lies at Valence, on the
Rhone, where D’Orsay was with his regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
under orders to march with the Duc d’Angoulême
over the Pyrenees. But to war’s alarms D’Orsay
was now deaf. He heard above the din of
trumpet and of drum the call of love, and
answered to it. He resigned his commission.
For at the hotel where was established the
regimental mess the Blessingtons arrived on
November 15th; the romance of love eclipsed
the romance of war.</p>

<p>From this point onward there can be little
doubt as to D’Orsay’s position as regards Lady
Blessington, but as concerns Blessington everything
grows more and more extraordinary, and
more and more discreditable to the blind or easy-going
husband. Charles Greville says that
Blessington was really fond of the fascinating
young Frenchman. He looked on him as a
charming, happy comrade. It was at his persuasion
that D’Orsay threw up his commission,
Blessington making “a formal promise to the
Count’s family that he should be provided for.”
At any rate such provision was made later on.
Greville adds that D’Orsay’s early connection
with Lady Blessington was a mystery; certainly
it was so as far as concerns the behaviour of the
lady’s husband. D’Orsay’s conduct is explicable
in two ways: either infatuation for a beautiful
woman blinded him to his real interests and
rendered him unable to count the cost of the
course he now decided to pursue, or he preferred
to that of the soldier the <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i> life of a
dependent loafer. Possibly, however, the two
motives mingled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The company was now complete and each
member of it apparently entirely content. They
moved on to Orange, and on November 20th
reached Avignon, at which place a considerable
stay was made. Avignon! Petrarch and Laura!
Lady Blessington and Count d’Orsay! Glory
almost overwhelming for any one town. The
battlemented walls; the ancient bridge; the
swift stream of the Rhone; the storied palace of
the Pope; and the famous fountain of Vaucluse,
given to fame by Petrarch; a proper setting for
the love of Alfred and of Marguerite.</p>

<p>They stayed at the <i lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</i>, a comfortable
hostelry, an inn which many years before
had been the scene of an incident which formed
the groundwork of the comedy of <cite>The Deaf
Lover</cite>. It was now the scene of incidents which
might well have supplied the materials for a
comedy of <cite>The Blind Husband: or, There are
None so Short-sighted as those who Won’t See!</cite></p>

<p>There was gaiety and society at Avignon,
much social coming and going, dinners, dances,
receptions and routs. The Duc and Duchesse
de Caderousse Grammont, who resided in a
château close to the town, were doubtless delighted
to see their young connection the Count,
and to welcome his friends. Lady Blessington
enjoyed herself immensely, and it is interesting
to know that her refined taste was charmed by
the decorum of French dancing:—</p>

<p>“The waltz in France,” she writes, “loses its
objectionable familiarity by the manner in which
it is performed. The gentleman does not clasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his fair partner round the waist with a freedom
repugnant to the modesty and destructive to the
<i lang="fr">ceinture</i> of the lady; but so arranges it, that he
assists her movements, without incommoding her
delicacy or her drapery. In short, they manage
these matters better in France than with us;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and though no advocate for this exotic dance, I
must admit that, executed as I have seen it, it
could not offend the most fastidious eye.”</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was, as we know, an authority
upon “objectionable familiarity.” What would
this fastidious dame have thought of the shocking
indelicacy of modern ball-room romps? Would
“kitchen” Lancers have appealed favourably to
her? Would her approbation have honoured
the graceful cake-walk? But we must not linger
over such nice inquiries; we must not lose ourselves
in the maze of might-have-beens, but
must move on to fact, Southward ho! To Italy,
the land of Love and Olives.</p>

<h2 id="V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">BYRON</span></h2>

<p>Genoa was reached on the last day of March
1823, and Lady Blessington, as also doubtless
D’Orsay, because of the sweet sympathy between
two hearts that beat as one, was enraptured with
the beautiful situation of the town, in her Journal
breaking forth into descriptive matter which must
be the envy of every conscientious journalist.
Their entrance was made by night, and they
found lodging at the <i lang="it">Alberga del la Villa</i>, a
house situated upon the sea front, bedecked with
marble balconies and the rooms adorned with a
plenitude of gilding that brought comfort to the
simple heart of Lady Blessington. But it was
not by matters so material as its beauties or the
comforts of its inns that her soul was really
touched. To be in Genoa was to be in the same
place as Byron, of whom the very morrow might
bring the sight. The only fly in the honey
was that the poet might still be fat, as, alack,
Tom Moore had reported him to be when at
Venice. An imperfect peer is sad enough; but
an obese poet—Oh, fie!</p>

<p>On April first, auspicious date, the fair
inspirer of poems met with the writer of them,
the vision being not entrancing but disappointing
to the eager lady. What it was to the poet we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
do not know, though there are, indeed, quite firm
grounds for surmising that Byron was not
entirely pleased by the invasion of the privacy
which he so jealously guarded, by the intrusion
upon his retirement of the Blessingtons even
when accompanied by D’Orsay.</p>

<p>Ingenuity was practised in order to secure
admission. The day selected for the drive out to
Albano was rainy, a circumstance which it was
calculated would compel even the most curmudgeonly
of poets to offer hospitality and
shelter. The event proved the soundness of the
calculation. The carriage drew up to the gates
of the <i lang="it">Casa Saluzzo</i>; the two gentlemen alighted,
sent in their names, were admitted, were cordially
welcomed. Outside in the downpour sat the two
pretty ladies. We know not what emotion, if
any, agitated Marianne Power; but who can
doubt that painful anxiety and doubt fluttered in
the bosom of her sister? Would Byron, or would
Byron not? To be admitted or not to be
admitted? Of what count were all the charms
of Genoa, what weighed all the joys of illicit love,
if she could not gain admission to the presence of
the poet whose conversation—and her own—she
was destined to record?</p>

<p>Slowly the minutes passed. Then at last
came relief. Byron had learned that the ladies
were at his gates; breathless, hatless, he ran
out.</p>

<p>“You must have thought me,” he gasped,
“quite as ill-bred and <i lang="fr">sauvage</i> as fame reports in
having permitted your ladyship to remain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
quarter of an hour at my door: but my old friend
Lord Blessington is to blame, for I only heard a
minute ago that it was so highly honoured. I
shall not think you do not pardon (<i lang="la">sic</i>) this
apparent rudeness, unless you enter my abode—which
I entreat you will do.”</p>

<p>So the lady reports his speech, the which is
precisely the manner in which Byron would have
expressed himself—more or less.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was quite easily mollified,
granting the pardon so gracefully sought, accepting
his assisting hand, and, crossing the courtyard,
passed into the vestibule. Before them bowed
the uniformed <i lang="fr">chasseur</i> and other obsequious attendants,
all showing in their faces the surprise
they felt at their master displaying so much
cordiality in his reception of the visitors.</p>

<p>The whole account in her Journal gives
promise of the eminence to which Lady Blessington
afterward attained as a writer of fiction.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was disappointed in Byron
as Oscar Wilde was by the Atlantic and Mr
Bernard Shaw is by the world. He did not
reach the ideal she had framed of the author of
<cite>Childe Harold</cite> and <cite>Manfred</cite>. He was a jovial,
vivacious, even flippant man of the world. His
brow should have been gloomy with sardonic
melancholy, and his eyes shadowed by a hidden
grief which not even love or the loveliness of
Lady Blessington could assuage. But, alas, for
the evanescence of ideals!</p>

</div>

<p>Of this meeting we also have Byron’s version.
He writes to Moore:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miladi seems highly literary, to which and
your honour’s acquaintance with the family, I
attribute the pleasure of having seen them. She
is also very pretty, even in a morning,—a species
of beauty on which the sun of Italy does not
shine so frequently as the chandelier. Certainly
English women wear better than their Continental
neighbours of the same sex.”</p>

<p>Accounts differ as to whether Byron did or
did not extend familiar friendship to the Blessingtons;
it really does not much matter—if at all.
But it is of importance to know that he fell before
the charms of the irresistible D’Orsay. Indeed
so blinded was he with admiration that he not
only discovered the young Frenchman to be
“clever, original, unpretending,” but also stated
that “he affected to be nothing that he was not.”
We fancy D’Orsay would not have counted an
accusation of modesty as a compliment. In such
a man, properly conscious of his gifts, modesty
can only be a mockery. Mock modesty is to the
true what mock is to real turtle—an insolent
imitation. D’Orsay was above all things candid,
when there existed no valid reason for being
otherwise.</p>

<p>While at Genoa D’Orsay drew Byron’s
portrait, which afterward formed the frontispiece
to Lady Blessington’s <cite>Conversations of Lord
Byron</cite>, which is quite the most realistic and
skilful of her ladyship’s works of fiction. The
poet gave the painter a ring, a souvenir not to be
worn for it was too large. It was made of lava,
“and so far adapted to the fire of his years and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
character,” so Byron wrote to Lady Blessington,
through whose hand he conveyed the gift, perchance
deeming that by so doing he would
enhance its value.</p>

<p>Byron’s yacht, the <i>Bolivar</i>, was purchased by
Blessington for £300, having cost many times
that sum. The vessel was fitted in the most
sumptuous manner; soft cushions, alluring
couches, marble baths, every extravagance that
the heart of a woman could conceive or the purse
of man pay for; suitable surroundings for our
modern Antony and Cleopatra.</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">PILGRIMS OF LOVE</span></h2>

<p>“The Pilgrims from St James’ Square”
travelled onward through Florence to Rome,
from which latter city they were driven in haste
by the heat and the fear of malaria; so to Naples
where they arrived on July 17th. It was from
the hill above the <i lang="it">Campo Santo</i> that they gained
their first view of the town where they were to
spend so many happy hours. On the brow of
the eminence the postilions pulled up the horses,
so that the travellers might at their leisure survey
the wonderful panorama; the towers, the steeples,
the domes, the palaces, the multitude of gardens,
the blue waters of the famous Bay; Vesuvius outlined
against the spotless sky; from behind the
Isle of Capri the sun sending up broad shafts of
light; directly below them the high walls and the
solemn cedars of the city of the dead.</p>

<p>At the hotel <i lang="it">Gran Bretagna</i>, facing the sea,
they secured comfortable quarters commanding a
fine view over the Bay, which enchanted Lady
Blessington. But it was quickly decided that a
less noisy abode was desirable, and after a prolonged
house-hunting the Palazzo Belvedere at
Vomero was engaged. Before they could move
into it English comforts had to be superimposed
upon Italian magnificence, much to the amazement
of the Prince and Princess Belvedere, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
had not found their home lacking in anything
material. Blessington must have been born
with the bump of extravagance highly developed,
and Lady Blessington did not do anything to
depress it. The gardens of the <i lang="it">Palazzo</i> were
superb and delightful the views they commanded.
So in these luxurious surroundings the toil-worn
travellers settled down to contentment—though
the heat was intense.</p>

<p>Of the rooms we may note that the <i lang="fr">salon</i>
was a spacious apartment, of which the four
corners were turned into so many independent
territories, of which one was occupied by Lady
Blessington’s paper-strewn table, and another
by D’Orsay’s, artistically untidy; the others were
allotted to Marianne Power and to young Charles
Mathews. Blessington had his own private
sanctum, in which he busied himself with literary
and artistic enterprises, all of which were still-born,
except a novel, concerning which Jekyll
gives this advice: “Don’t read Lord Blessington’s
<cite>Reginald de Vavasour</cite> … duller than death.”</p>

<p>How charming a morning spent in that salon
in that charming company: the Lady of the
House, romantic and tender; D’Orsay, debonair
and gracious; Marianne, pretty, never in the
way, never out of it when her company was
wanted; and gay, young Charles Mathews
intent upon his drawings. To them enter, upon
occasion fitting or otherwise, the Lord of the
House, too full of his own affairs to heed the
affair that was going on before his eyes, or
heedless of it, who can say which; now bestowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a caress upon his adoring wife, now casting a
heavy jest to his young <i lang="fr">protégé</i>, the Count; now
summoning Mathews to come into his room and
discuss the plans for the superb home that he was
going to build in Ireland, but which remained a
castle in the air.</p>

<p>Charles James Mathews, who was born December
26th, 1803, was in his early years destined
for the Church, but his exuberant high spirits
scarcely foreshadowed success in that walk of
life. Having evinced a decided taste for architecture,
he was articled to Augustus Pugin,
whose office he entered in 1819. Charles James
was a lively lad, quick of wit and ready of
tongue, a well-read young fellow, too. In
August, 1823, the elder Mathews received a
letter from Blessington, who had returned from
Italy and with whom he had long been intimately
acquainted, expressing his intention to build a
house at Mountjoy Forest and to give the
younger Mathews “an opportunity of making his
<i lang="fr">début</i> as an architect.” So off to the North of
Ireland went Charles James, and for a couple of
months lived a very jolly life with his “noble
patron.” The plans for the new house were approved,
but it was considered necessary to consult
Lady Blessington before any final decisions were
arrived at, and, eventually, the whole scheme
was shelved. Young Mathews was invited by
Blessington to accompany him on his return to
Italy, and—says Mathews—“on the twenty-first
of September, 1823, eyes were wiped and handkerchiefs
waved, as, comfortably ensconced in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
well-laden travelling carriage, four post-horses
rattled us away from St James’ Square.”</p>

<p>So it will be seen that kindly Blessington left
Marguerite and Alfred to take care of each other
this summer time, with Marianne to play gooseberry.
Expeditions here, there and everywhere,
were the order of the day; drives along the
coast, or in the evening down into Naples, to the
Chiaja thronged with carriages. There were
many English then resident in Naples, among
them Sir William Gell, whom D’Orsay once
described as “Le brave Gell, protecteur-général
des <em>humbugs</em>.” He was evidently a bit of a
“character”; a man of learning, withal, who
wrote of the topography of Troy and the
antiquities of Ithaca; chamberlain to the eccentric
Queen Caroline, in whose favour he gave his
evidence; an authority on Pompeii—and an
amiable man. Mathews speaks of him as “Dear,
old, kind, gay Sir William Gell, who, while
wheeling himself about the room in his chair, for
he was unable to walk a step without help,
alternately kept his friends on the broad grin
with his whimsical sallies” and talked archæological
“shop”; “his hand was as big as a leg
of mutton and covered with chalkstones”; nevertheless
he could draw with admirable precision.</p>

<p>Greville tells of him, some years later, as living
in “his eggshell of a house and pretty garden,
which he planted himself ten years ago, and calls
it the Boschetto Gellio.” Moore speaks of him
as “still a coxcomb, but rather amusing.”</p>

<p>He was a man of sound humour; he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
make fun out of his own misfortunes, as in this
letter written from Rome in 1824: “I am sitting
in my garden, under the shade of my own vines
and figs, my dear Lady Blessington, where I
have been looking at the people gathering the
grapes, which are to produce six barrels of what
I suspect will prove very bad wine; and all this
sounds very well, till I tell you that I am positively
sitting in a wheelbarrow, which I found the
only means of conveying my crazy person into
the garden. Don’t laugh, Miss Power.”</p>

<p>He was not always respectful to his royal
mistress, for he accuses her of being capable of
saying, “O trumpery! O Moses!”</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was indeed fortunate in the
guides who chaperoned her on her visits to the
many interesting places around Naples; Uwins,
the painter, escorted her to picture-galleries and
museums; so did Westmacott, the sculptor;
Herschel, afterward Sir John, accompanied her
to the Observatory; Sir William Gell was her
cicerone at Pompeii, and to D’Orsay fell the
honour of everywhere being by her side.</p>

<p>Pompeii inspired Lady Blessington to verse—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Lonely city of the dead!</div>
<div class="verse">Body whence the soul has fled,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving still upon thy face</div>
<div class="verse">Such a mild and pensive grace</div>
<div class="verse">As the lately dead display,</div>
<div class="verse">While yet stamped upon frail clay,</div>
<div class="verse">Rests the impress of the mind,</div>
<div class="verse">That the fragile earth refined.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The house-party was once again complete when
Blessington and Mathews arrived in November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Mathews fancied he had dropped into
Paradise, and gives a glowing description of his
environment: “The Palazzo Belvedere, situated
about a mile and a half from the town on the
heights of Vomero, overlooking the city, and the
beautiful turquoise-coloured bay dotted with
latine sails, with Vesuvius on the left, the island
of Capri on the right, and the lovely coast of
Sorrento stretched out in front, presented an
enchanting scene. The house was the perfection
of an Italian palace, with its exquisite frescoes,
marble arcades, and succession of terraces one
beneath the other, adorned with hanging groves
of orange-trees and pomegranates, shaking their
odours among festoons of vines and luxuriant
creepers, affording agreeable shade from the
noontide sun, made brighter by the brilliant
parterres of glowing flowers, while refreshing
fountains plashed in every direction among
statues and vases innumerable.”</p>

<p>Among the company Mathews found one of
about his own age, with whom he struck up a
firm friendship; D’Orsay was naturally a fascinating
companion and exemplar for any young
man of parts. Enthusiasm glows in the
following description: “Count d’Orsay … I
have no hesitation in asserting was the <i lang="fr">beau-idéal</i>
of manly dignity and grace. He had not yet
assumed the marked peculiarities of dress and
deportment which the sophistications of London
life subsequently developed. He was the model
of all that could be conceived of noble demeanour
and youthful candour; handsome beyond all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
question; accomplished to the last degree;
highly educated, and of great literary acquirements;
with a gaiety of heart and cheerfulness
of mind that spread happiness on all around him.
His conversation was brilliant and engaging, as
well as clever and instructive. He was moreover
the best fencer, dancer, swimmer, runner, dresser;
the best shot, the best horseman, the best draughtsman
of his age.” There are some touches of
exaggeration here, but it is valuable as the impression
made upon a shrewd youth of the world.</p>

<p>He notes, too, that D’Orsay spoke English
in the prettiest manner; maybe with a touch
of Marguerite’s brogue.</p>

<p>Mathews has given us a description of
the routine of life at the Palazzo Belvedere:—“In
the morning we generally rise from
our beds, couches, floors, or whatever we
happen to have been reposing upon the night
before, and those who have morning gowns or
slippers put them on as soon as they are up.
We then commence the ceremony of washing,
which is longer or shorter in its duration,
according to the taste of the persons who use it.
You will be glad to know that from the moment
Lady Blessington awakes she takes exactly one
hour and a half to the time she makes her
appearance, when we usually breakfast; this
prescience is remarkably agreeable, as one can
always calculate thus upon the probable time of
our breakfasting; there is sometimes a difference
of five or six minutes, but seldom more. This
meal taking place latish in the day, I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have a premature breakfast in my own room the
instant I am up, which prevents my feeling that
hunger so natural to the human frame from
fasting. After our collation, if it be fine we set
off to see sights, walks, palaces, monasteries,
views, galleries of pictures, antiquities, <em>and all
that sort of thing</em>; if rainy, we set to our drawing,
writing, reading, billiards, fencing, and <em>everything
in the world</em>.… In the evening each person
arranges himself (and herself) at his table and
follows his own concerns till about ten o’clock,
when we sometimes play whist, sometimes talk,
and are always delightful! About half-past
eleven we retire with our flat candlesticks in
our hands.… At dinner Lady B. takes
the head of the table, Lord B. on her
left, Count d’Orsay on her right, and I at the
bottom. We have generally for the first service
a joint and five <i lang="fr">entrées</i>; for the second, a <i lang="fr">rôti</i>
and five <i lang="fr">entrées</i>, including sweet things. The
name of our present cook is Raffelle, and a very
good one when he likes.”</p>

<p>A heated but brief quarrel between D’Orsay
and Mathews gives us a glimpse of the former’s
hot temper. The two had become constant comrades,
fencing, shooting, swimming, riding, drawing
together.</p>

<p>Blessington had formed the habit of boring
the party by insisting on their accompanying
him on sailing trips aboard the <i>Bolivar</i>, his
purchase from Byron, which expeditions had
more than once culminated in their being becalmed
for hours and overwhelmed with heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and <i lang="fr">ennui</i>. One sultry morning when Blessington
suggested a sail, they with one consent began to
make excuses, good and bad: the ladies were
afraid of the sun; D’Orsay said a blunt “No,”
and Mathews was anxious to complete a sketch.
To which last Lord Blessington remarked—</p>

<p>“As you please. I only hope you will really
carry out your intention; for even your friend
Count d’Orsay says that you carry your sketch-book
with you everywhere, but that you never
bring back anything in it.”</p>

<p>Possibly there was an element of truth in the
criticism; at any rate it struck home.</p>

<p>It was apparently a somewhat sulky party
that went a-driving that afternoon; two charming
women and two ill-humoured young men.
Suddenly, without any further provocation,
Mathews burst out—</p>

<p>“I have to thank you, Count d’Orsay, for the
high character you have given me to Lord Blessington,
with regard to my diligence.”</p>

<p>“Comment?” responded D’Orsay.</p>

<p>“I should have been more gratified had you
mentioned to me, instead of to his lordship, anything
you might have—”</p>

<p>“Vous êtes un mauvais blagueur, par Dieu, la
plus grande bête et blagueur que j’ai jamais rencontré,
et la première fois que vous me parlez
comme ça, je vous casserai la tête et je vous jetterai
par la fenêtre.”</p>

<p>Indubitably ill-temper, of which we know
not the cause, had made the Count forget his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
manners; Mathews rightly kept silent, reserving
the continuation of the quarrel for a future and
more proper occasion, and Lady Blessington
aided him by the rebuke—</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay, I beg you to remember I
am present, and that such language is not exactly
what I should have expected before me.”</p>

<p>But the fiery Frenchman was not to be suppressed
and answered hotly.</p>

<p>In the evening Mathews received a note from
D’Orsay, repeating the offence in almost more
offensive terms. Of course, a duel was the order
of the day; Mathews wrote demanding satisfaction
or an apology; of which former he was promptly
promised all he might desire to have. Mathews
found his friend Madden willing to act as his
second, but Blessington very naturally, as host of
both the parties, refused to act for the Count.
But Madden was a diplomatist, and despatched to
D’Orsay what his principal terms a “very coolly
written” letter, which called forth the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Cher Mr Madden</span>,—Je suis très loin
d’être fâché que Mr Mathews vous ait choisi pour
son témoin, ma seule crainte eut été qu’il en

<p>“Je suis aussi très loin d’être offensé d’un de
vos avis. Lorsque j’estime quelqu’un, son opinion
est toujours bien reçue.</p>

<p>“L’affaire, comme vous savez, est très simple
dans le principe. On me fit la question si
Mathews avait dessiné à Caprée; je dis que non,
mais qu’il emportoit toujours ses crayons et son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
album pour ne rien faire—que cela étoit dommage
avec ses grandes dispositions. Lord Blessington
n’as pas eu le courage de lui représenter sans y
mêler mon nom, et Mathews a pris la chose avec
moi sur un ton si haut que j’ai été obligé de la
rabaisser, après lui avoir exprimé que ce n’étoit
que par intérêt pour lui que j’avois fait cette représentation.
Il à continué sur le même ton; je
lui dis alors que la première fois qu’il prendroit un
ton semblable avec moi je le jetterois hors de la
voiture et lui casserois la tête. J e vous répète mot
pour mot cette altercation. La seule différence que
j’ai fait entre lui et un autre, c’est que je n’ai fait
que dire ce que j’aurois fait certainement vis-à-vis
d’un autre qui prendroit ce ton avec moi. Si j’ai
accompagné mon projet d’avenir de mots offensants
et inconvenants, j’en suis aussi fâché pour
lui que pour moi, car c’est me manquer à moi-même
que d’user des mots trop violents.</p>

<p>“Pour votre observation sur la différence des
rangs, elle est inutile, car jamais je n’attache
d’importance au rang qui se trouve souvent compromis
par tant de bêtes. Je juge les personnes
pour ce qu’elles sont, sans m’informer qui étoient
leurs ancêtres, et si mon supérieur eut employé
la même manière de me rapprocher qu’a pris
Mathews, j’aurois sûrement fait ce que je n’ai fait
que dire à Mathews, que j’aime beaucoup trop
pour le rabaisser à ses propres yeux. Il seroit
ridicule à moi de ne pas avouer que j’ai tort de
lui avoir dit des paroles trop fortes, mais en
même temps je ne veux pas nier mes paroles,
c’est-à-dire, mon projet de voiture, etc. Si<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Mathews veut satisfaction, je lui donnerai tant
qu’il lui plaira, tout en lui sachant bon gré de vous
avoir choisi pour son témoin.</p>

<p>“Cette affaire est aussi désagréable pour vous
que pour nous tous, mais au moins elle n’altérera
pas l’amitié de votre tout dévoué,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Cte. d’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Upon receipt of which letter Madden advised
Mathews to shake hands, which on meeting the
Count the following morning he proceeded to do,
the overture of peace being cordially received.</p>

<p>“J’espère, mon cher Mathews,” said D’Orsay,
“que vous êtes satisfait. Je suis bien fâché pour
ce que je vous ai dit, mais j’étais en colère et—”</p>

<p>To which Mathews, interrupting—</p>

<p>“Mon cher Comte, n’en parlons plus, je vous
en prie, je l’ai tout-à-fait oublié!”</p>

<p>But apparently Lady Blessington had something
to say upon the affair, for later on Mathews
found the Count with her, in tears, and a further
apology followed.</p>

<p>Then the storm-clouds cleared away and all
again was sunshine.</p>

<p>Madden who played the peacemaker, was
Richard Robert of that name, born in 1798, and
at that time studying medicine at Naples. In
after years he was author of <cite>The United Irishmen</cite>,
and of that curious book, <cite>The Literary Life and
Correspondence of the Countess of Blessington</cite>.
Mathews writes of him as “the witty, lively Dr
Madden, at that time as full of spirits as of mental
acquirements.”</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<p>Here stands D’Orsay, <i lang="fr">jeune premier</i>, the hero
of this comedy <i lang="fr">à trois</i>, with the limelight full
upon him; supported by Marguerite, Lady
Blessington, as leading lady, of whom Landor
said to Crabb Robinson:—“She was to Lord
Blessington the most devoted wife he ever
knew,” which either speaks badly for the wives
known to Walter Savage or more probably
shows that he was as blind in the matter of the
lady’s virtue as he was with regard to her age,
which in 1832 he declared to be about thirty.
Probably in both cases he was judging simply by
appearances, which in women are so apt to
deceive men, particularly elderly poets.</p>

<p>For what part shall we consider Lord
Blessington as cast? Villain or fool? We
incline to the latter: it takes a fairly astute man
to play the villain with success; moreover, no
man smiles and smiles and is a villain without
motive for his villainy—at least not in real life.
To complete our company we have two light
comedians, Marianne Power, pretty and ever
ready with a smile, and Mathews, always ready
to provide amusing entertainment. For stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
crowd, diplomatists, antiquarians, artists, noblemen,
servants and so forth:—</p>

<p>Sir William Gell, whom we have met, with
pleasure; an Hon. R. Grosvenor, whom Lady
Blessington declared “the liveliest Englishman I
have ever seen,” and considered that his gaiety
sat very gracefully upon him; queens of beauty,
too, such as the Duchess di Forli, “with hair
dark as the raven’s wing, and lustrous eyes of
nearly as deep a hue, and her lips as crimson as
the flower of the pomegranate”; the Princess
Centolla, who “might furnish a faultless model
for a Hebe, she is so fair, so youthful, and so
exquisitely beautiful”; an Hanoverian soldier of
fortune, who came down to fight in Sicily and
captured the heart and wealth of the Princess
Bultera and her title too; the lively, diminutive,
aged Thomas James Mathias, writer of that
pungent satire upon authors, <cite>Pursuits of Literature</cite>,
whose denial of his being the only begetter
of it did not meet with credence. He was a man
with peculiarities, one of which was the frequent
use of the exclamation, “God bless my soul!”
Another was his singularly accurate memory for
dates connected with the eating of any special
dish. It was fortunate for him that motor-cars
were not of his day, for he was extremely
nervous when crossing the street. He appears
also to have been curiously simple. One day
while dining in a café a shower of rain came
down heavily, and Sir William Gell remarked to
Mathias that it was raining cats and dogs. On
the instant, as luck would have it, a dog ran in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
at one door and a cat at the other. “God bless
my soul,” said Mathias, solemnly, “so it does!
so it does! Who would have believed it!”</p>

<p>There was Sir William Drummond, scholar
and diplomatist, minister-plenipotentiary to
Naples, whose brilliant conversation was a
mixture of pedantry illuminated by flashes of
imagination; the Archbishop of Tarentum, a
typical father of the Roman Church, “his face,
peculiarly handsome, is sicklied o’er with the pale
hue of thought; his eyes are of the darkest
brown, but soft, and full of sensibility, like those
of a woman. His hair is white as snow, and
contrasts well with the black silk <i lang="fr">calotte</i> that
crowns the top of his head. His figure is attenuated
and bowed by age, and his limbs are small
and delicate…;” the astronomer Piazzi, discoverer
of the planet Ceres; General the Duc di’
Rocco Romano, “the very personification of a
<i lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>; brave in arms, and gentle and
courteous in society”; Lord Dudley, eccentric as
is easily pardoned in a peer with an income of
£40,000, with his unfortunate habit of expressing
aloud his opinion, good or bad, of those with
whom he conversed; James Milligan, the antiquary,
to whom it was mere waste of time to
submit a forgery as a genuine antique; Casimir
de la Vigne, who recited his unpublished
‘Columbus’ at the <i lang="it">Palazzo</i>.</p>

<p>Fine company, of which but a few have been
named; a liberal education in themselves to a
young man on his way through a world where the
proper study of mankind is man—and woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In junketings and journeyings the days sped
by very merrily. Blessington himself was not
fond of walking and was an enemy to sight-seeing
of all kinds, so did not often join in the
expeditions. Moreover, he was not an early
riser, usually breakfasting in bed, and we cannot
imagine that his company was very greatly
missed; four is company, five is a crowd. The
expeditionary party, therefore, consisted of Lady
Blessington and D’Orsay, Marianne Power and
Mathews; to which various guests were added
as occasion and convenience dictated.</p>

<p>The romantic beauty of the gardens of the
Palazzo appealed to at any rate some of the
members of the household. In the evening they
would resort to the charming Pavilion at the end
of the terrace, and there listen to the playing and
singing of the servants, some of whom proved to
be delectable masters of music. There was, too,
an open-air theatre in the grounds; the stage of
springy turf, the proscenium formed of trees and
shrubs, the seats of marble, backed by hedges of
trimmed box and ilex. This shady playhouse
the company frequented in the heat of the day;
fruits and iced drinks were served. A pleasant
earthly paradise, wherein the tempting of Adam
by Eve was highly civilised—in its externals.</p>

<p>There were dinners on board the <i>Bolivar</i>, in
the cabin wherein, it is said, Byron wrote much
of “Don Juan”; D’Orsay must have felt quite in
his element there.</p>

<p>In March 1825, the <i lang="it">Palazzo Belvedere</i> was
deserted for the <i lang="it">Villa Gallo</i> at Capo di Monte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a less palatial but more comfortable abode, also
possessing grounds of great beauty.</p>

<p>It was not until February 1826 that our party
left Naples, where they had so greatly enjoyed
themselves, returning to Rome, where they remained
for a few weeks, going thence in April
to Florence and in December being once again
in Genoa. In Florence it may be noted that the
Blessingtons and D’Orsay met Landor, with whom
they quickly came to be upon terms of friendship.</p>

<p>It was while on their first visit to Genoa, three
years before this, that news had reached
Blessington of the death at the age of ten of his
son and heir, Lord Mountjoy. Of this unhappy
event one of the results was that Blessington was
able to make such disposition of his property as
he considered right and proper, or at any rate
to a certain and very considerable extent. Of
this freedom he availed himself in a manner that
proves either a lack of common understanding or
actual inhumanity. Included in the arrangements
he made was the marriage to D’Orsay of one of
his daughters, this apparently in fulfilment of his
promise to see to it that D’Orsay’s future was
provided for. Not content that the young
Frenchman should be his wife’s lover he decided
to make him also his daughter’s husband. Such
a story told as fiction would be incredible.</p>

<p>Three months after his son’s death, Blessington
signed a codicil to his will, which ran thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having had the misfortune to lose my
beloved son, Luke Wellington, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
entered into engagements with Alfred, Comte
d’Orsay that an alliance should take place
between him and my daughter, which engagement
has been sanctioned by Albert, Comte
d’Orsay, general, etc., in the service of France.
This is to declare and publish my desire to leave
to the said Alfred d’Orsay my estates in the city
and county of Dublin (subject, however, to the
annuity of three thousand per annum, which sum
is to include the settlement of one thousand per
annum to my wife, Margaret, Countess of Blesinton
(<i lang="la">sic</i>) …). I make also the said Alfred
d’Orsay sole guardian of my son Charles John,
and my sister, Harriet Gardiner, guardian of my
daughters, until they, the daughters, arrive at the
age of sixteen, at which age I consider they will
be marriageable.… (Signed) <span class="smcap">Blesinton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In August (1823) this amazing plan was more
securely fixed by the making of a will. By this
document D’Orsay was appointed one of three
executors, each of whom received £1000; to
Lady Blessington was allotted £2000 British, per
annum, and all her own jewels. Then we must
quote in full:—“I give to my daughter, Harriet
Anne Jane Frances, commonly called Lady
Harriet, born at my house in Seymour Place,
London, on or about the 3rd day of August 1812,
all my estates in the county and city of Dublin,
subject to the following charge. Provided she
intermarry with my friend, and intended son-in-law,
Alfred d’Orsay, I bequeath her the sum of
ten thousand pounds only. I give to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
daughter, Emily Rosalie Hamilton, generally
called Lady Mary Gardiner, born in Manchester
Square, on the 24th of June 1811, whom I now
acknowledge and adopt as my daughter, the sum
of twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“In case the said Alfred d’Orsay intermarries
with the said Emily, otherwise Mary Gardiner, I
bequeath to her my estates in the county and city
of Dublin.…” It did not matter upon which
daughter the gallant and chivalrous D’Orsay fixed
his fancy; in either case he was to be well rewarded.
D’Orsay knew that his future was
assured.</p>

<p>In fact, D’Orsay was handsomely dowered!
How joyous must have been the meeting between
him and his sister at Pisa in 1826. Lady
Blessington has left a pleasant picture of it in
her Journal:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Pisa.</span>—Arrived here yesterday, and found
the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche (Ida d’Orsay)
with their beautiful children, established in the
Casa Chiarabati, on the south side of the Lung’
Arno. The Duchesse is one of the most striking-looking
women I ever beheld; and though in
very delicate health, her beauty is unimpaired.
Tall and slight, her figure is finely proportioned,
and her air remarkably noble and graceful. Her
features are regular, her complexion dazzlingly
fair, her countenance full of intelligence, softened
by a feminine sweetness that gives it a peculiar
attraction, and her limbs are so small and symmetrical,
as to furnish an instance of Byron’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
favourite hypothesis, that delicately formed hands
and feet were infallible indications of noble birth.
But had the Duchesse de Guiche no other charm
than her hair, that would constitute an irresistible
one. Never did I see such a profusion, nor of
so beautiful a colour and texture. When to those
exterior attractions are added manners graceful
and dignified, conversation witty and full of
intelligence, joined to extreme gentleness, it
cannot be wondered at that the Duchesse de
Guiche is considered one of the most lovely and
fascinating women of her day. It is a pleasing
picture to see this fair young creature, for she is
still in the bloom of youth, surrounded by her
three beautiful boys, and holding in her arms a
female infant strongly resembling her. One
forgets <i lang="fr">la grande dame</i> occupying her tabouret
at Court, ‘the observed of all observers,’ in the
interest excited by a fond young mother in the
domestic circle, thinking only of the dear objects
around her.”</p>

</div>

<p>Who better could appreciate this happy scene
than Lady Blessington, with all her dear objects
around her: her sister, her husband, her dear
friend?</p>

<p>One more Pisan scene is worth quoting:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>March.</i>—Mr Wilkie,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> our celebrated painter,
has come to spend a few days with us. He
enjoys Italy very much, and his health is, I am
happy to say, much improved. He was present,
last evening, at a concert at the Duchesse de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Guiche’s, where a delicate compliment was offered
to her, the musicians having surprised her with
an elegantly turned song, addressed to her, and
very well sung; copies of which were presented
to each of the party, printed on paper <i lang="fr">couleur de
rose</i>, and richly embossed. This <i lang="fr">galanterie</i>
originated with half a dozen of the most distinguished
of the Pisans, and the effect was excellent,
owing to the poetic merit of the verses, the good
music to which they were wedded, and the unaffected
surprise of the fair object to whom they
were addressed. Mr Wilkie seemed very much
pleased at the scene, and much struck with the
courtly style of beauty of our hostess.”</p>

</div>

<p>Summer faded into autumn, but surely not too
quickly for the ardent D’Orsay, who must have
longed to take to his arms his schoolgirl bride,
who was coming over from Dublin, where she
had spent her childhood in the care of her aunt.</p>

<p>It was a cruel thing to do, to fling this girl
not yet sixteen years of age into the arms of a
man entirely strange to her, who could not even be
likely to learn to love her consumed with passion
as he already was for another. What chance
had the child of happiness? As little as had
Marguerite Power when forced to marry Farmer.
Did Lady Blessington recall her first wedding-day
as she stood by and watched this sacrifice?
She could not speak; her tongue was tied; what
could it be to her if D’Orsay married? And
D’Orsay, what word of exculpation or excuse can
be said for him? Not one. Had he been free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
intrigue this marriage would have been a mere
episode—as marriage then was and now so often
is—in the life of a man of the world. The
little schoolgirl must marry someone; why not
D’Orsay? D’Orsay must have money, why not
obtain it by this simple means? Even if he had
desired to hold back, what excuse could he offer—to
Blessington? There have been few scenes
so grimly sardonic, not one more tragic.</p>

<p>On December 1st 1827, Count Albert d’Orsay,
only son of General Count d’Orsay, was married
to Lady Harriet Anne Frances Gardiner at the
British Embassy at Naples. Never can nuptials
have been bigger with ill-fortune, which was the
only fruit they bore.</p>

<p>Some few months after the wedding Madden
met the bride at Rome, and writes of her:—</p>

<p>“Lady Harriet was exceedingly girlish-looking,
pale and rather inanimate in expression,
silent and reserved; there was no appearance of
familiarity with any one around her; no air or
look of womanhood, no semblance of satisfaction
in her new position were to be observed in her
demeanour or deportment. She seldom or ever
spoke, she was little noticed, she was looked on
as a mere schoolgirl; I think her feelings were
crushed, repressed, and her emotions driven
inwards, by the sense of slight and indifference,
and by the strangeness and coldness of everything
around her; and she became indifferent,
and strange and cold, and apparently devoid of
all vivacity and interest in society, or in the
company of any person in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Juliet mated with Lothario. Doubtless the
latter was quite contented with his bargain, as
indeed he had good cause to be. He had been
paid a fine price for bending his neck to the yoke
matrimonial, as is shown by the marriage settlements
to which act the parties were Lord
Blessington, D’Orsay, Lady Harriet, the Duc de
Guiche, Lieutenant-General and Ecuyer of His
Royal Highness the Dauphin, and Robert Power,
formerly Captain of the 2nd Regiment of Foot.
The deed is specifically stated as being designed
to make provision for D’Orsay and Lady Harriet,
“then an infant of the age of fifteen years or
thereabouts.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ROME</span></h2>

<p>Early one night in December 1827, the Blessingtons,
the D’Orsays and Marianne Power arrived
in Rome to find that the palace hired for their
accommodation was entirely unsuitable and insufficient.
House-hunting once again was the
order of the day, the outcome being the renting
of the two principal floors of the Palazzo Negroni
for six months at one hundred guineas per month.
Additional and doubtless unnecessary furniture
was hired at a further cost of twenty guineas. It
is quite amusing to hear of the domesticated
Lady Blessington undertaking the transformation
of countless yards of white muslin into window
curtains and to see to a dozen or so of eiderdown
pillows being recased so that the hardness
of half-stuffed sofas might be softened. Her
account of the advantages of possessing a
<i lang="fr">fourgon</i> must be given in her own words, which
could not be re-written without diminishing their
merit:—</p>

<p>“Thence comes the patent brass bed, that
gives repose at night; and the copious supply of
books, which ensure amusement during the day.
Thence emerges the modern invention of easy-chairs
and sofas to occupy the smallest space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
when packed; <i lang="fr">batteries de cuisine</i>, to enable
a cook to fulfil the arduous duties of his
<i lang="fr">métier</i>; and, though last, not least, cases to
contain the delicate <i lang="fr">chapeaux</i>, <i lang="fr">toques</i>, <i lang="fr">bérets</i>; and
<i lang="fr">bonnets</i> of a Herbault, too fragile to bear the
less easy motion of leathern bandboxes crowning
imperials.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the noble authoress found it impossible
to write unadulterated Saxon after listening
through so many hours to D’Orsay’s gallant
but broken English.</p>

<p>At this time there were many English folk in
Rome, to accommodate whose insular fancies there
were English shops, including a confectionery
establishment, which contributed to the indigestions
of the British and the entertainment of the
Romans. It was the custom then for English
travellers at Rome to make a point of doing what
the Romans did not do; happily all that has been
changed for the better and to-day the Britisher
abroad, and equally his cousins from America,
behave themselves with consideration and becoming
modesty, always.</p>

<p>Here, as at Naples, D’Orsay made a large and
interesting circle of friends. Among these was
to be numbered the French Ambassador, the Duc
de Laval-Montmorenci, an antique who afforded
much amusement. He is described as having
been a curious mixture of opposites; simple and
at the same time acute, well-bred and clownish,
ostentatious and prudent, witty and wise—the last
a very rare combination; an old-fashioned <i lang="fr">beau</i>
in spite of his short memory and his deafness, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
short sight and his unfortunate stammer; a
capital hand at an anecdote, good-tempered,
good-humoured. One of his quaint peculiarities
was the habit of falling asleep during a conversation;
then an awakening after a few minutes’ nap
to exclaim:—“<i lang="fr">Oui, oui, vous avez bien raison,
c’est clair: je vous fais mes compliments: c’est
impossible d’être plus juste.</i>”</p>

<p>“Middle Ages” Hallam was another friend
of these days, when also Walter Savage Landor
was met again.</p>

<p>The time was passed in a round of merry
makings by all save the silent child-wife.</p>

<p>Then in May their backs were turned upon
Rome, or as Lady Blessington has it—“We
leave the Eternal City—perhaps to see it <em>no more</em>.
This presentiment filled me with sadness when
I this evening from the Monte Pincio saw the
golden sun sink beneath his purple clouds, his
last beams tinging with a brilliant radiance the
angel on the fortress of St Angelo, and the glorious
dome of St Peter’s.”</p>

<p>Of all their friends the one with whom they
were most loath to part was Sir William Gell,
who when bidding farewell to Lady Blessington
said: “You have been visiting our friend
Drummond’s grave to-day, and if you <em>ever</em> come
to Italy again, you will find me in mine.”</p>

<p>He died some eight years later, on 4th April
1836. Of his last days Keppel Craven wrote an
account to Lady Blessington:—</p>

<p>“He never ceased, I don’t say for an hour,
but an <em>instant</em>, to have a book open before him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and though he sometimes could not fix his eyes
for two minutes at a time on its contents, he
nevertheless understood it, and could afterwards
talk of the work in a manner which proved, that
while his mental powers were awake, they were
as strong as ever—more especially his memory;
but the state he was in, caused much confusion
in his ideas of time and distance, of which he was
aware, and complained of.”</p>

<p>The first Lord Lytton wrote of Gell: “I
never knew so popular or so petted a man as Sir
William Gell; every one seems to love him.”</p>

<p>Gell was a capital letter-writer, as the following
example will suffice to show. In April 1824,
he writes to Lady Blessington:</p>

<p>“I did really arrive at Rome … having experienced
in the way every possible misfortune,
except being overturned or carried into the mountains.
In short, I know nothing to equal my journey,
except the ninety-nine misfortunes of Pulicinella
in a Neapolitan puppet-show. I set out without
my cloak in an open carriage; my only hope of
getting warmer at St Agatha was destroyed by
an English family, who had got possession of the
only chimney. I had a dreadful headache, which,
by-the-bye, recollecting to have lost at your house
by eating an orange, I tried again with almost
immediate effect. Next morning one grey horse
fell ill at the moment of being put to the carriage,
and has continued so ever since, so that I have
had to buy another, which is so very (what they
call) good, that it is nearly as useless as the other,
so that I never go out without risking my neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
When, at length, I got to Rome in a storm of
sleet, I found a bill of an hundred and fifty dollars
against me for protecting useless lemon-trees
against the frost of the winter, which, added to
the expense of the new horse and the old one
have ever since caused the horrors of a gaol to
interpose themselves between me and every
enjoyment, and so much for the ugly side of the
question.”</p>

<p>Through Loretto, Ancona, Ravenna, Ferrara,
Padua, the Blessingtons and company made their
way to Venice, where they halted for several
weeks, and where once again they forgathered
with Landor. Then by Verona and Milan to
Genoa, and in June 1828 they arrived in Paris.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">PARIS</span></h2>

<p>Back again in Paris, which lay blistering under
the hot summer sun. Rooms were secured at
the <i lang="fr">Hôtel de Terrace</i> in the Rue de Rivoli; noisy
quarters, and Lady Blessington was not fond of
noise.</p>

<p>“On entering Paris,” says Lady Blessington,
“I felt my impatience to see our dear friends
then redouble; and, before we had despatched
the dinner awaiting our arrival, the Duc and
Duchesse de Guiche came to us. How warm was
our greeting; how many questions to be asked
and answered; how many congratulations and
pleasant plans for the future to be formed.…”
Doubtless D’Orsay was again congratulated on
having married a fortune.… “The Duchesse
was in radiant health and beauty, and the Duc
looking, as he always does, more <i lang="fr">distingué</i> than
anyone else—the perfect <i lang="fr">beau-idéal</i> of a nobleman.
We soon quitted the <i lang="fr">salle à manger</i>; for
who could eat during the joy of a first meeting
with those so valued?”</p>

<p>The attitude of D’Orsay’s family throughout
this strange affair is amazing. Can they have
really understood the situation? Did they thank
Blessington for having provided so munificently
for their brother? Did they express their gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to Lady Blessington for the many favours
she had shown to him? We can scarcely believe
it so. But however all these things were, the
evening passed pleasantly; the windows of the
<i lang="fr">salon</i> looked out over the garden of the Tuileries,
over their scented orange-trees and formal walks.</p>

<p>The Comte and Comtesse d’Orsay were also
in Paris, later on, and great must have been their
satisfaction at seeing their son so well settled. Of a
dinner at their house Lady Blessington—<i lang="fr">la belle
mère</i> of their son—says there was a “large family
party. The only stranger was Sir Francis
Burdett. A most agreeable dinner followed
by a very pleasant evening.” Did Countess
Alfred enjoy it?</p>

<p>The next day Lady Blessington devoted to
shopping, visiting among other high shrines of
fashion Herbault’s, where the latest things in
caps, hats and turbans were tried and sentenced;
then on to Mdlle. La Touche where <i lang="fr">canezus</i> and
<i lang="fr">robes de matin</i> were selected. Three hundred and
twenty francs were given for a crape hat and
feathers, two hundred for a <i lang="fr">chapeau à fleurs</i>, one
hundred for a <i lang="fr">negligé de matin</i>, and eighty-five for
an evening cap of tulle trimmed with blonde and
flowers.</p>

<p>The hotel was a mere stop-gap, and the
Blessingtons settled down in a house belonging
to the Marquis de Lillers, which had once been
the residence of Marshal Ney; it was situated in
the Rue de Bourbon, the principal rooms giving
on the Seine and commanding a view over the
Tuileries’ gardens. The sumptuous scale of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
decorations is typified by those of the bathroom,
where the bath of marble was sunk in a tessellated
pavement, and over it swung an alabaster
lamp hanging from the beak of a dove, the ceiling
being painted with Cupids and flowers; the
walls were panelled alternately with mirrors and
allegorical groups. Furniture, equally luxurious,
was hired—dark crimson carpets with golden
borders, crimson satin curtains also bordered in
gold, sofas and chairs upholstered in crimson
satin and richly gilded, gilt <i lang="fr">consoles</i>, buhl cabinets,
a multitude of mirrors; a veritable orgy of gold
and glitter. But all else was surpassed by the
Blessington’s <i lang="fr">chambre à coucher</i> and her dressing-room,
which she found to be exquisite, at any
rate, to her taste: the silvered bedstead was supported
on the backs of two large silver swans,
the recess in which it stood being lined with
white fluted silk, bordered with blue lace; pale
blue curtains, lined with white, closed in its
sanctity. There was a silvered sofa, rich coffers
for jewels and for lace, a pale blue carpet, a lamp
of silver … “a more tasteful or elegant suite
of apartments cannot be imagined!” For the
housing of beauty and virtue what more fitting
than silver, white and light blue? “Chastely
beautiful,” so said its owner. Then, Heaven commend
us to the unchaste.</p>

<p>Gaiety was the order of the day, as it ever
was when Lady Blessington and D’Orsay were in
command; drives in the Bois de Boulogne with
the Duchesse de Guiche; evenings at Madame
Crawford’s, whom Lady Blessington describes as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
gifted with “all the naïveté of a child. She possesses
a quick perception of character and a freshness
of feeling rarely found in a person of her
advanced age.” Here is a truly touching family
group at a leave-taking breakfast: “It was touching
to behold Madame Crawford kissing again
and again her grandchildren and great-grand-children,
the tears streaming down her cheeks,
and the venerable Duc de Grammont, scarcely less
moved, embracing his son and daughter-in-law,
and exhorting the latter to take care of her health,
while the dear little Ida, his grand-daughter, not
yet two years old, patted his cheek, and smiled
in his face.” Doubtless Madame Crawford was
not a little proud of her gallant D’Orsay; we
wonder what opinion, if any, she formed of his
bride, and whether she congratulated her on
marrying the grandson of a king?</p>

<p>Among other places of interest to which expeditions
were made none can have come
more closely home to the heart of Lady Blessington
than D’Orsay, the fortified château of
the family with which she was now so closely
connected.</p>

<p>Two letters written by members of the party
to Landor are interesting, not only as showing
the terms of friendship between the writers and
the recipient. The first was from Blessington,
dated 14th July:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh! it is an age, my dear Landor, since
I thought of having determined to write.
My first idea was to defend <cite>Vavaseur</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the book was lent to one friend or another,
and always out of the way when the pen
was in hand. My second inclination was, to
inquire after you and yours; but I knew
that you were not fond of corresponding, so
that sensation passed away. And now my
third is to tell you that Lady B. has taken an
apartment in the late residence of Marshal Ney,
and wishes much that some whim, caprice, or
other impelling power, should transform you
across the Alps, and give her the pleasure of
again seeing you. Here we have been nearly
five weeks, and, unlike Italy and its suns, we
have no remembrance of the former, but in the
rolling of the thunder; and when we see the
latter, we espy at the same time the threatening
clouds on the horizon. To balance or assist such
pleasure, we have an apartment <i lang="fr">bien décoré</i> with
<i lang="fr">Jardin de Tuileries en face</i>, and our apartment
being at the corner, we have the double advantage
of all the <em>row</em>, from morn till night. Diligences
and fiacres—coachmen cracking their
whips, stallions neighing—carts with empty wine-barrels—all
sorts of discordant music, and all
sorts of cries, songs, and the jingling of
bells.…”</p>

</div>

<p>The second letter is from D’Orsay, who dates
his note 4th September, and writes from the
Hôtel Ney:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“J’ai reçu, mon cher M. Landor, votre lettre.
Elle nous a fait le plus grand plaisir. Vous
devriez être plus que convaincu que j’apprécirois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
particulièrement une lettre de vous, mais il paroit
que notre intimité de Florence ne compte pour
rien à vos yeux, si vous doutez du plaisir que vos
nouvelles doivent produire dans notre intérieur.
Sitôt que je recevrai les tableaux je ferai votre
commission avec exactitude. Je desirerois bien
que vous veniez à Paris, car nous avons de belles
choses à vous montrer; surtout en fait de tableaux.
A propos de cela, je vous envoye ci
joint le portrait du Prince Borghése que vous
trouverez j’espère ressemblant.… Nous parlons
et pensons souvent de vous, il est assez
curieux que vous soyez en odeur de sainteté dans
cette famille, car il me semble que ce n’est pas
la chose dont nous vous piquiez particulièrement
d’être. Lady B. et toutes nos dames vous envoye
mille amitiés, et moi je ne fais que renouveller
l’assurance de la sincérité de la mienne.
Votre très affectionné,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of a visit to the opera this is a pleasant
reminiscence:—“Went to the Opera last night,
where I saw the <i lang="fr">début</i> of the new <i lang="fr">danseuse</i>
Taglioni. Hers is a totally new style of dancing;
graceful beyond all comparison, wonderful
lightness, an absence of all violent effort, or at
least of the appearance of it, and a modesty as
new as it is delightful to witness in her art.…
The Duc de Gazes, who came into the Duchesse
de Guiche’s box, was enthusiastic in his praises
of Mademoiselle Taglioni, and said hers was the
most poetical style of dancing he had even seen.
Another observed that it was indeed the poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of motion. I would describe it as the epic of
dancing,” a not very brilliant remark for a woman
of reputed wit.</p>

<p>Henry Greville writing in 1832 says:
“Taglioni is dancing at Covent Garden; it is
impossible to conceive the perfection to which
she has brought the art. She is an animated
statue; her motions are the perfection of grace
and decency, and her strength quite marvellous.”
And again in Paris, four years later, when she
was still highly proper: “Her grace and <i lang="fr">décence</i>
are something that no one can imagine who has
not seen her.” The actor complains that nothing
remains of his art by which posterity can judge
him; but the dancer can, at any rate, leave behind
a reputation for propriety—while on the stage.</p>

<p>A welcome visitor was Charles Kemble, who
dined with the Blessingtons, and after dinner
read to the party his daughter’s, Fanny Kemble’s
play, <cite>Francis the First</cite>. “I remembered,” says
Lady Blessington, “those pleasant evenings
when he used to read to us in London, hour
after hour, until the timepiece warned us to give
over. I remembered, too, John Kemble—‘the
great John Kemble,’ as Lord Guildford used to
call him—twice or thrice reading to us with Sir
T(homas) Lawrence; and the tones of Charles
Kemble’s voice, and the expression of his face,
forcibly reminded me of our departed friend.”</p>

<p>In 1829 an event befell, which probably
altered the course of D’Orsay’s career, and which
may be counted as a nice stroke of irony on the
part of Fate, that past-mistress of the ironical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of the repeal of the civil disabilities
inflicted upon the Irish Catholics had
grown to be a burning question, and Lord
Rosslyn wrote anxiously to Paris, urging
Blessington to go over to London to support
in the House of Lords the Duke of Wellington’s
Catholic Emancipation Act. On July 15th,
Blessington set out for England; “his going,”
wrote his wife, “at this moment, when he is
far from well, is no little sacrifice of personal
comfort; but never did he consider himself
when a duty was to be performed. I wish the
question was carried, and he safely back again.”
While in town he presided at the Covent Garden
Theatrical Fund annual dinner. After an absence
of only a few days he returned to Paris, apparently
in improved health, and—indulgent husband
that he was—laden with gifts for his lovely wife.</p>

<p>But disaster was at hand. While riding out
in the heat he was seized with apoplexy in
the Champs Elysées. He lingered, speechless,
until half-past four on the following Monday
morning when he breathed his last. Lady
Blessington was stunned with grief by the
sudden calamity.</p>

<p>The remains were conveyed to Dublin, where
they were interred in Saint Thomas’ Church,
Marlborough Street.</p>

<p>What epitaph are we to write? What
character to paint of this man, so well-beloved,
yet possessing so little strength, so little self-restraint,
such a pittance of ability? Landor
wrote of him to Lady Blessington—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Blessington</span>,—If I defer it
any longer, I know not how or when I shall
be able to fulfil so melancholy a duty. The
whole of this day I have spent in that torpid
depression, which you may feel without a great
calamity, and which others can never feel at
all. Every one that knows me, knows the
sentiments I bore towards that disinterested, and
upright, and kind-hearted man, than whom none
was ever dearer, or more delightful to his friends.
If to be condoled with by many, if to be esteemed
and beloved by all whom you have admitted to
your society is any comfort, that comfort at least
is yours. I know how inadequate it must be
at such a moment, but I know too that the
sentiment will survive when the bitterness of
sorrow shall have passed away.”</p>

</div>

<p>And again he writes to her:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Too well was I aware how great my pain
must be in reading your letter. So many hopes
are thrown away from us by this cruel and
unexpected blow. I cannot part with the one
of which the greatness and the justness of your
grief almost deprives me, that you will recover
your health and spirits. If they could return at
once, or very soon, you would be unworthy of
that love which the kindest and best of human
beings lavished on you. Longer life was not
necessary for him to estimate your affection for
him, and those graces of soul which your beauty
in its brightest day but faintly shadowed. He
told me that you were requisite to his happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and that he could not live without you. Suppose
that he had survived you, his departure in that
case could not have been so easy as it was,
unconscious of pain, of giving it, or of leaving
it behind. I am comforted at the reflection
that so gentle a heart received no affliction
from the anguish and despair of those he
loved.”</p>

</div>

<p>Five years later Lady Blessington writes to
Landor:—</p>

<p>“I have often wished that you would note
down for me your reminiscences of your friendship,
and the conversations it led to with my
dear and ever-to-be-lamented husband; he who
so valued and loved you, and who was so little
understood by the common herd of mankind.
We, who knew the nobleness, the generosity,
and the refined delicacy of his nature, can render
justice to his memory.…”</p>

<p>Amid all this sugar, it is quite refreshing to
come across a little acid, and Cyrus Redding
speaks out quite plainly of Lady Blessington.
He says: “She was a fine woman; she had
understood too well how to captivate the other
sex. She had won hearts, never having had a
heart to return. No one could be more bland
and polished, when she pleased. She understood
from no short practice, when it was politic
to be amiable, and yet no one could be less
amiable, bland and polished when her temper
was roused, and her language being then well
suited to the circumstances of the provocation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
both in style and epithet.… The gentry of
this country, of all political creeds, are frequently
censured for their pride and exclusiveness; but
they may sometimes be proud and exclusive to
no ill end. The higher ranks have their exceptions,
as well as others, of which Lord Blessington himself
was an instance. The dissipation of Lord
Blessington’s fortune, and the reception of Lady
Blessington’s favourite, the handsome youth,
D’Orsay, into Lord Blessington’s house, ran together,
it has been said, before the finish of his
education. Old Countess d’Orsay was scarcely able
to do much for her son, owing to the narrowness of
her income; but no family could be more respectable
than hers. Lord Blessington was a weak-minded
creature, and his after-dinner conversations, when
the wine was in, became wretchedly maudlin.”</p>

<p>However, exit Lord Blessington and end
Act One of our tragi-comedy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="X">X<br />
<span class="smaller">A SOLEMN UNDERTAKING</span></h2>

<p>Our hero henceforth will occupy the centre of
the stage, as a right-minded hero should do,
beside him the shadowy figure of his wife
gradually fading away into the background
until at last quite invisible, and that of the flamboyant
personage of the widow of our hero’s
dead patron. Truly ironical; while Blessington
lived and was an “obstacle” in the way of the
course of true love there had seemed to D’Orsay
to be no other way of settling his fortunes than
to marry one or other of Blessington’s daughters,
he cared not which. Now that the obstacle had
been removed and the widow was free to be
openly wooed and won, the path he had chosen to
pursue appeared of those ways that had been open
to him to be the most stupid. The lady who had
been shackled was free; the lover who had been
free was now shackled. Fortune is a humorist
and her jokes are always at our expense, which
makes it difficult for us to laugh with her.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was clever in the choice of
her physician, who prescribed company as a cure
for depression of spirits. So we read in her ladyship’s
Diary:—</p>

<p>“My old friends Mr and Mrs Mathews, and
their clever son have arrived in Paris, and dined
here yesterday. Mr Mathews is as entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
as ever, and his wife as amiable and <i lang="fr">spirituelle</i>.
They are excellent as well as clever people,
and their society is very agreeable. Charles
Mathews, the son, is full of talent, possesses
all his father’s powers of imitation, and sings
comic songs of his own composition that
James Smith himself might be proud to have
written.”</p>

<p>Old and young Mathews delighted with their
songs and recitations a party attended among
others by the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche
Madame Crawford and Count Walewski.</p>

<p>Later on we find Rogers and Luttrell calling
upon her, and the former chatting of Byron. Lady
Blessington mentions a lampoon which the great
had written on the little poet, and which Byron
had read to her and D’Orsay one day at Genoa.</p>

<p>“I thought you were one of Mr Rogers’s
most intimate friends, and so all the world had
reason to think, after reading your dedication
of the <cite>Giaour</cite> to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Byron, with a laugh, “and it is
our friendship that gives me the privilege of
taking a liberty with him.”</p>

<p>“If it is thus you evince your friendship, I
should be disposed to prefer your enmity.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Byron, “you could never excite
this last sentiment in my heart, for you neither
say nor do spiteful things.”</p>

<p>Of Luttrell, Lady Blessington held a high
opinion: “His conversation, like a limpid stream,
flows smoothly and brightly along, revealing the
depths beneath its current, now sparkling over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the objects it discloses or reflecting those by
which it glides. He never talks for talking’s
sake; but his mind is so well filled that, like a
fountain which when stirred sends up from its
bosom sparkling showers, his mind, when excited,
sends forth thoughts no less bright than profound,
revealing the treasures with which it is so
richly stored. The conversation of Mr Luttrell
makes me think, while that of many others only
amuses me.”</p>

<p>Luttrell, who was a natural son of Lord Carhampton,
was born about 1765, dying in 1851.</p>

<p>Charles Greville tells us of these two friends,
they were “always bracketed together, intimate
friends, seldom apart, and always hating, abusing,
and ridiculing each other. Luttrell’s <i lang="fr">bons mots</i> and
repartees were excellent, but he was less caustic,
more good-natured, but in some respects less
striking in conversation than his companion, who
had more knowledge, more imagination, and
though in a different way, as much wit.”</p>

<p>An entry in Henry Greville’s “Diary” is
amusing, bearing in mind the above about Rogers
and Byron:—</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, October 27</i> (1836).—Dined with
Lady Williams, Lord Lyndhurst, and Rogers.
The latter said Lord Byron was very affected,
and his conversation rarely agreeable and a constant
effort at wit. I said I supposed he knew a
great deal and had read. He answered: ‘If you
believe Moore he has read everything. I don’t
believe he ever read at all!’ Rogers hated Byron,
and was absurd enough to be jealous of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Poets do not dwell together in unity.</p>

<p>Rogers even in his young days was known,
by reason of his corpse-like appearance, as the
Dead Dandy; and later on a wag said to him:
“Rogers, you’re rich enough, why don’t you keep
your hearse?”</p>

<p>This is a dinner-party that must have been
interesting, Lord John Russell, Rogers, Luttrell,
Thiers, Mignet, and Poulett Thomson; Lady
Blessington says:—</p>

<p>“Monsieur Thiers is a very remarkable
person—quick, animated, and observant; nothing
escapes him, and his remarks are indicative of a
mind of great power. I enjoy listening to his
conversation, which is at once full of originality,
yet free from the slightest shade of eccentricity.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Mignet, who is the inseparable
friend of Monsieur Thiers, reminds me every
time I see him of Byron, for there is a striking
likeness in the countenance.”</p>

<p>The following reads strangely, so much have
our habits and manners changed since 1829:—</p>

<p>“We dined at the Rocher de Cancale
yesterday; and Counts S⸺ and Valeski
(Walewski) composed our party. The Rocher
de Cancale is the Greenwich of Paris; the
oysters and various other kinds of fish served up
<i lang="it">con gusto</i>, attracting people to it, as the white-bait
draw visitors to Greenwich. Our dinner was
excellent, and our party very agreeable.</p>

<p>“A <i lang="fr">dîner de restaurant</i> is pleasant from its
novelty. The guests seem less ceremonious and
more gay; the absence of the elegance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
marks the dinner-table appointments in a <i lang="fr">maison
bien montée</i>, gives a homeliness and heartiness to
the repast; and even the attendance of two or
three ill-dressed <i lang="fr">garçons</i> hurrying about, instead
of half-a-dozen sedate servants in rich liveries,
marshalled by a solemn-looking <i lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i>
and groom of the chambers, gives a zest to the
dinner often wanted in more luxurious feasts.”</p>

<p>Then what shall we say to this for a sleighing-party,
save that we would that we also had been
there?</p>

<p>“The prettiest sight imaginable was a party
of our friends in sledges.… Count A.
d’Orsay’s sledge presented the form of a dragon,
and the accoutrements and horse were beautiful;
the harness was of red morocco, embroidered in
gold.… The dragon of Comte A. d’Orsay
looked strangely fantastic at night. In the
mouth, as well as the eyes, was a brilliant red
light; and to a tiger-skin covering, that nearly
concealed the cream-coloured horse, revealing
only the white mane and tail, was attached a
double line of silver-gilt bells, the jingle of which
was very musical and cheerful.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lady Blessington, the D’Orsays, and Marianne
Power remained on for some considerable time
in Paris after the death of Lord Blessington,
the Revolution of 1830 providing them with
some excitement. D’Orsay was always out and
about, and though his brother-in-law de Guiche
was a well-known legitimist and he himself a
Bonapartist, the crowd was quite ready to greet
the dandy with good-humoured shouts of “Vive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
le Comte d’Orsay.” Your crowd of <i lang="fr">sans-culottes</i>
dearly loves a dandy.</p>

<p>Here is a quite pretty picture by Lady
Blessington:—</p>

<p>“<i>6th August.</i>—I walked with Comte d’O(rsay)
this evening into the Champs Elysées, and great
was the change effected there within the last few
days. It looks ruined and desolate, the ground
cut up by the pieces of cannon and troops as
well as the mobs that have made it a thoroughfare,
and many of the trees greatly injured, if
not destroyed.</p>

<p>“A crowd was assembled around a man who
was reading aloud for their edification a proclamation
nailed to one of the trees. We
paused for a moment to hear it, when some of
the persons, recognising my companion, shouted
aloud, ‘<i lang="fr">Vive le Comte d’Orsay! Vive le Comte
d’Orsay!</i>’ and the cry being taken up by the
mass, the reader was deserted, the fickle multitude
directing all their attention and enthusiasm
to the new-comer.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay’s love of the fine arts induced him
to make an effort to save the portrait of the
Dauphin by Lawrence which hung in the
Louvre. To achieve this he sent two of his
servants, Brement, formerly a drill-sergeant in
the Guards, and Charles, an ex-Hussar; they
found the picture, torn to ribbons and the
fragments strewn upon the floor.</p>

<p>As another example of his epistolary style
we will quote this following from D’Orsay to
Landor, dated Paris, 22nd Août, 1830:—</p>

<p>“Je viens de recevoir votre lettre du 10.
Il falloit un aussi grand événement pour avoir
de vos nouvelles. Le fait est que c’est dans
ces grandes circonstances que les gens bien
pensant se retrouvent. Vous donner des détails
de tout l’héroïsme qui a été déployé dans ces
journées mémorables, et difficiles il faudroit un
Salluste pour rendre justice, et d’écrire cette
plus belle page de l’histoire des temps modernes.
On ne sait quoi admirer de plus, de la valeur dans
l’action, ou de la modération après la victoire.
Paris est tranquille comme la veille d’un jour de
fête, it seroit injuste de dire comme le lendemain,
car la réaction de la veille donne souvent une
apparence <em>unsettled</em>, tandis qu’ici tout est digne
et noble, le grand peuple sent sa puissance.
Chaque homme se sent relevé à ses propres yeux,
et croiroit manquer à sa nation en commettant le
moindre excès. Vous, véritable philosophe, serait
heureux de voir ce qu’a pu faire l’éducation en
40 années; voir ce peuple après, ou à l’époque
où La Fayette le commanda pour la première fois,
est bien différent; en 1790—l’accouchement
laborieux de la liberté eut des suites funestes,
maintenant l’on peut dire que la mère et l’enfant
se portent bien. Notre présent Roi est le
premier citoyen de son pays, il sent bien que les
Rois sont faits pour les peuples, et non les
peuples pour les Rois. Si Charles Dix eut
pensé de même s’il eut été moins Jésuite, nous
aurions encore cette Race Capétienne. Ainsi
comme il n’y a aucun moyen curatif connu pour
guérir de cette maladie, il est encore très heureux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
qu’il ait donné l’excuse légale pour qu’on

Adieu, pour le moment. Votre très affectionné,</p>

<p>Before leaving Paris for London we must
quote from Madden a passage which proves
conclusively that not every Irishman has a saving
sense of humour. “Shortly before the death of
Count d’Orsay’s mother,” he writes, “who entertained
feelings of strong attachment for Lady
Blessington, the former had spoken with great
earnestness of her apprehensions for her son, on
account of his tendency to extravagance, and of
her desire that Lady Blessington would advise
and counsel him, and do her utmost to counteract
those propensities which had already been
attended with embarrassments, and had occasioned
her great fears for his welfare. The promise that
was given on that occasion was often alluded to
by Lady Blessington, and after her death, by
Count d’Orsay.”</p>

<p>Such a solemn undertaking must of course be
carried out by an honourable woman, so when
the Paris establishment was broken up by
Lady Blessington, Count and Countess d’Orsay
followed in her train, so that they might be near
by to receive her counsel and advice.</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">SEAMORE PLACE</span></h2>

<p>The London in which D’Orsay was destined to
spend the majority of his remaining years, and
of which he became so distinguished an ornament
is far away from modern London, farther away
from us, in fact, in manners, customs and
appearance than it was from the metropolis of
the England of Queen Elizabeth. Astounding
is the change that has come about since the year
1830; the advent of steam and electricity, the
stupendous increase of wealth, the extension of
education if not of culture, wrought a revolution
during the nineteenth century. The first half
of that century has rightly been described as
“cruel, unlovely, but abounding in vital force.”
London was then a city very dull to look upon,
very dirty, very dismal; hackney coaches were
the chief means of locomotion for those who
could not afford to keep their own chariot, and
were rumbling, lumbering, bumpy vehicles,
whose drivers were dubbed jarvies. Fast young
men were beginning to sport a cabriolet or cab;
omnibuses were of the future. “Bobbies” had only
come into being recently, taking the place of the
watchmen and Bow Street runners, who hitherto
had taken charge of the public morals. Debtors
were treated worse than we now treat criminals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
gaming-houses were in abundance, and to their
proprietors profitable institutions. Drinking
shops were open to any hour of the night, and
drinking to excess was only gradually ceasing to
be a gentlemanly, even a lordly, diversion; clubs
in our modern sense of the word were comparatively
few, coffee-houses, chop-houses, and
taverns occupying their place to some extent.
Restaurants and fashionable hotels were not,
and ladies dined at home when their husbands
disported themselves abroad. Prize-fighting was
in its heyday; duelling was the fashion.</p>

<p class="caption-r">[TO FACE PAGE 100</p>

</div>

<p>To this London, which, however, was not so
dull as it looked, D’Orsay came in November
1830, taking up his residence with Lady
Blessington and his wife in St James’ Square.
But Lady Blessington soon found that her
jointure of £2000 a year could not by any
stretching meet the expenses of such an
establishment, and that a removal to cheaper
quarters was compulsory. D’Orsay and his
wife took furnished lodgings in Curzon Street,
but later on joined Lady Blessington in the
house in Seamore Place, which she had rented
from Lord Mountford and furnished with an
extravagance worthy of an ill-educated millionaire.
As for example, let us take a peep into the
library—Lady Blessington was very literary—which
looked out upon Hyde Park; the ceiling
was arched and from it hung a lamp of splendour;
there were enamelled tables crowded with costly
trinkets and knick-knacks; the walls were lined
with a medley of mirrors and book-cases, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as chief adornment Lawrence’s delightful portrait
of the mistress of the house, now in the Wallace
Collection. The dining-room was octagonal, and
environed by mirrors; it was an age of mirrors
and cut glass.</p>

<p>Joseph Jekyll writes on June 20th, 1831:
“<i lang="it">Nostra senora</i>, of Blessington, has a house
of <i lang="fr">bijoux</i> in Seymour (<i lang="la">sic</i>) Place. Le Comte
d’Orsay, an Antinous of beauty and an exquisite
of Paris, married the rich daughter of Lord
Blessington, and they live here with <i lang="fr">la belle
mère</i>.” And on 18th July:—“The Countess
of Blessington gave a dinner to us on Friday.
Lord Wilton, General Phipps, Le Comte d’Orsay,
and myself—<i lang="fr">Cuisine de Paris exquise</i>. The
pretty melancholy Comtesse glided in for a few
minutes, and then left us to nurse her influenza.
The Misses Berry tell me they have dined
with the Speaker and wife, who have thrown
my Blessington overboard.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The English at
Naples called my friend the Countess of
Cursington.”</p>

<p>In January of the next year Jekyll was again
present at a dinner in Seamore Place, other
guests being George Colman, James Smith,
Rogers and Campbell; “There was wit, fun,
epigram, and raillery enough to supply fifty
county members for a twelvemonth. <i lang="fr">Miladi</i> has
doffed her widow’s weeds, and was almost in
pristine beauty. Her house is a <i lang="fr">bijou</i>, or, as Sir
W. Curtis’ lady said, ‘a perfect bougie.’”</p>

<p>At Seamore Place Lady Blessington, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
D’Orsay as ally and master of the ceremonies,
gathered around her many of the most interesting
and distinguished men of the time—statesmen,
soldiers, writers, painters, musicians, actors, and
many gay butterflies of fashion.</p>

<p>But the triple alliance was soon reduced to a
dual, Lady Harriet leaving Seamore Place, her
husband and her stepmother—who doubtless had
given her much good counsel and advice—in
August, 1831. It was not, however, until
February, 1838, that a formal deed of separation
was executed. This diminution of the number
of the household in nowise damped the gaiety
of the two who were left behind, indeed the
presence of the child-wife must often have been
a wet-blanket. As far as D’Orsay was concerned,
she had fulfilled her fate by supplying him with
an income, which he speedily overspent and
frittered away. It is surely a blot upon our
social economy that such a man should have
been driven to such a course in order to secure
the means of living. There ought to be a young-age
pension for dandies, and their debts ought
to be paid by the State, thus leaving them free
to do their duty without harassing cares as to
ways and means. A dandy of the first water
is a public benefactor and as such should be
subsidised.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Parker Willis, an American
journalist and verse writer, who wrote much
that is now little read, has given accounts of
various visits paid by him to Lady Blessington
and D’Orsay, to the mistress and to her master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
at Seamore Place, and, as was the case with
others who went there, apparently accepted the
Count’s constant presence as quite natural. In
truth, why should he not frequent the house of
his adorable stepmother-in-law? Even when he
was not chaperoned by his wife?</p>

<p>On the occasion of his first call Willis found
Lady Blessington reclining on a yellow satin sofa,
book in hand, her bejewelled fingers blazing with
diamonds. He tells us that he judged her ladyship
to be on the sunny side of thirty, being more
than ten years out in his surmise, which proves
that either the lady was extremely well preserved
or the visitor too dazzled by her beauty or her
diamonds to be in full possession of his powers of
observation. But then, what man could be so
ungallant as to guess any pretty woman’s age at
more than thirty?</p>

<p>She was dressed in blue satin, which against
the yellow of the couch must have produced an
hysterically Whistlerian fantasia. Willis describes
her features as regular and her mouth as expressive
of unsuspecting good-humour; her voice now
sad, now merry, and always melodious.</p>

<p>To them enter D’Orsay in all his splendour,
to whom the fascinated Willis was presented.</p>

<p>Thereon followed tea and polite conversation,
the talk very naturally turning upon America and
the Americans, Lady Blessington being anxious
to learn in what esteem such writers as the young
Disraeli and Bulwer were held in the States.</p>

<p>“If you will come to-morrow night,” she said,
“you will see Bulwer. I am delighted that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
popular in America. He is envied and abused—for
nothing, I believe, except for the superiority
of his genius, and the brilliant literary success it
commands; and knowing this, he chooses to
assume a pride which is only the armour of a
sensitive mind afraid of a wound. He is to his
friends the most frank and noble creature in the
world, and open to boyishness with those whom
he thinks understand and value him. He has a
brother, Henry,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who is also very clever in a
different vein, and is just now publishing a book
on the present condition of France.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Do they
like the D’Israelis in America?”</p>

<p>Willis replied that the <cite>Curiosities of Literature</cite>,
<cite>Vivian Grey</cite> and <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> were
much appreciated.</p>

<p>To which Lady Blessington graciously responded:</p>

<p>“I am pleased at that, for I like them both.
D’Israeli the elder came here with his son the
other night. It would have delighted you to see
the old man’s pride in him, and the son’s respect
and affection for his father. D’Israeli the elder
lives in the country, about twenty miles from
town; seldom comes up to London, and leads a
life of learned leisure, each day hoarding up and
dispensing forth treasures of literature. He is
courtly, yet urbane, and impresses one at once
with confidence in his goodness. In his manners,
D’Israeli the younger is quite his own character
of ‘Vivian Grey’; full of genius and eloquence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with extreme good-nature, and a perfect frankness
of character.”</p>

<p>After some further desultory chat, Willis asked
Lady Blessington if she knew many Americans,
to which the reply was—</p>

<p>“Not in London, but a great many abroad. I
was with Lord Blessington in his yacht at
Naples when the American fleet was lying there
… and we were constantly on board your ships.
I knew Commodore Creighton and Captain
Deacon extremely well, and liked them particularly.
They were with us frequently of an
evening on board the yacht or the frigate, and I
remember very well the bands playing always
‘God save the King’ as we went up the side.
Count d’Orsay here, who spoke very little English
at the time, had a great passion for ‘Yankee
Doodle,’ and it was always played at his request.”</p>

<p>Thereupon D’Orsay, in his pleasant, broken
English, inquired after several of the officers,
who, however, it turned out were not known to
Willis. The conversation afterward turned upon
Byron, and Willis asked Lady Blessington if she
knew the Countess Guiccioli.</p>

<p>“Yes, very well. We were at Genoa when
they were living there, but we never saw her.
It was at Rome, in 1828, that I first knew
her, having formed her acquaintance at Count
Funchal’s, the Portuguese Ambassador.”</p>

<p>In the evening Willis availed himself of
the invitation he had received, finding Lady
Blessington now in the drawing-room, with some
half dozen or so of men in attendance. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
these was James Smith, an intimate of D’Orsay’s,
in whose gaiety and <i lang="fr">savoir-faire</i> he delighted.
A pleasant story is this of later days, when Smith
met the Countess Guiccioli at Gore House.
After dinner these two chatted confidentially for
the remainder of the evening, chiefly of their
reminiscences of Byron, Leigh Hunt and Shelley.
D’Orsay saw Smith home to his residence in
Craven Street, and as he parted with him,
asked—</p>

<p>“What was all that Madame Guiccioli was
saying to you just now?”</p>

<p>“She was telling me her apartments are in
the Rue de Rivoli, and that if I visited the
French capital she hoped I would not forget her
address.”</p>

<p>“What! It took all that time to say that?
Ah! Smeeth, you old humbug! That won’t do!”</p>

<p>James Smith, who, with his brother Horace,
was the author of the <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>,
was born in 1775.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He was a wit in talk
and in prose as well as on paper and in verse.
Here are some lines he addressed to Lady
Blessington when she moved westward to Gore
House—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You who erst, in festive legions,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sought in <em>May Fair</em>, <em>Seamore</em> Place,</div>
<div class="verse">Henceforth in more westward regions</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Seek its ornament and grace.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Would you <em>see more</em> taste and splendour,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Mark the notice I rehearse—</div>
<div class="verse">Now at Kensington attend her—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Farther on, you <em>may fare</em> worse.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>Gout and rheumatism afflicted him sorely in
his latter years, though his face retained its hale
good looks. At Seamore Place—and on similar
occasions—he was compelled to move about with
the aid of a crutch, or in a wheel-chair, which he
could manœuvre himself, his feet sometimes
encased in india-rubber shoes. Despite his
infirmities his smile was always bright and his
tongue ready with a witticism.</p>

<p>When Jekyll asked him why he had never
married, the response came in verse—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Should I seek Hymen’s tie?</div>
<div class="verse indent4">As a poet I die,</div>
<div class="verse">Ye Benedicts mourn my distresses.</div>
<div class="verse indent4">For what little fame</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Is annexed to my name,</div>
<div class="verse">Is derived from <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But we must return to the drawing-room in
Seamore Place.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hostess, busily discussing
a speech of Dan O’Connell, stood a
dapper little man, rather languid in appearance,
but with winning, prepossessing manners, and a
playful, ready tongue; Henry Bulwer. There
were others, such as a German prince and a
French duke and a famous traveller. And—there
was D’Orsay, a host in himself in both
senses of the word, the best-looking, best-dressed,
most fortunate man in the room; yet despite it
all—there he sat in a careless attitude upon an
ottoman.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o’clock, the witching
hour, before Mr Lytton Bulwer (“Pelham”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was announced, who ran gaily up to his hostess,
and was greeted with a cordial chorus of “How
d’ye, Bulwer?” Gay, quick, partly satirical, his
conversation was fresh and buoyant. A dandy,
too!</p>

<p>Toward three o’clock i’ the morn James Smith
made a move and Willis his exit.</p>

<p>In June 1834, Willis dined at Seamore Place,
the hour appointed being the then unusually late
one of eight o’clock. Again the company, who
were awaiting the arrival of Tom Moore, was of
mingled nationalities—a Russian count, an Italian
banker, an English peer, Willis an American, and
for host and hostess, a French count and an Irish
peeress. Lady Blessington took the lead—so
says Willis, and he should know for he was there,
lucky dog—in the war of witty words that waged
round the dinner-table, and we may be sure that
D’Orsay was not among the hindmost.</p>

<p>The talk was turned by Moore upon
duelling—</p>

<p>“They may say what they will of duelling; it
is the great preserver of the decencies of society.
The old school, which made a man responsible
for his words, was the better. I must confess I
think so.” He then told an amusing story of an
Irishman—of all men on earth!—who “refused a
challenge on account of the illness of his daughter,”
and one of the Dublin wits made a good epigram
on the two—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Some men, with a horror of slaughter,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Improve on the Scripture command;</div>
<div class="verse">And ‘honour their’—wife and their daughter—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘That their days may be long in the land.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>The “two” being the gentleman above referred
to, and O’Connell, who had pleaded his wife’s
illness as an excuse upon a similar occasion.</p>

<p>“The great period of Ireland’s glory,” continued
Moore, “was between ’82 and ’98, and it
was a time when a man almost lived with a pistol
in his hand. Grattan’s dying advice to his son
was: ‘Be always ready with the pistol!’ He
himself never hesitated a minute.”</p>

<p>This we must take as a mere spark from
the coruscations of brilliancy that fell from the
lips of the beautiful hostess and her clever
guests, from whom she had the art of drawing
their best.</p>

<p>Coffee was served in the drawing-room.
Moore was persuaded to sing. Singing always
to his own accompaniment and in a fashion that
more nearly approached to recitation than to
ordinary singing, Moore was possessed of
peculiar gifts in the arousing of the emotions of
his hearers, and accounted any performance a
failure that did not receive the award of tears.
On this occasion, after two or three songs chosen
by Lady Blessington, his fingers wandered
apparently aimlessly over the keys for a while,
and then with poignant pathos he sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When first I met thee, warm and young,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">There shone such truth about thee,</div>
<div class="verse">And on thy lip such promise hung,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I did not dare to doubt thee.</div>
<div class="verse">I saw thee change, yet still relied,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Still clung with hope the fonder,</div>
<div class="verse">And thought, though false to all beside,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From me thou could’st not wander.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But go, deceiver! go—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The heart, whose hopes could make it</div>
<div class="verse">Trust one so false, so low,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Deserves that thou should’st break it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then when the last note had died away, he
said “Good-night” to his hostess, and before the
silence was otherwise broken—was gone.</p>

<p>Dizzy was party to a famous duel which did
not come off, consequent on fiery language used
by O’Connell, who courteously rated him thus:
“He is the most degraded of his species and his
kind, and England is degraded in tolerating and
having on the face of her society a miscreant of
his abominable, foul and atrocious nature. His
name shows that he is by descent a Jew. They
were once the chosen people of God. There
were miscreants amongst them, however, also,
and it must certainly have been from one of these
that Disraeli descended. He possesses just the
qualities of the impenitent thief that died upon
the cross, whose name I verily believe must have
been Disraeli.”</p>

<p>Dizzy put himself in D’Orsay’s hands, but the
latter thought that it would scarcely be becoming
for a foreigner to be mixed up in a political duel,
though he consented to “stage-manage” the
affair, which never came off, owing to O’Connell’s
oath never again to fight a duel.</p>

<p>D’Orsay was exceedingly ingenious in
drawing out the peculiarities of any eccentric
with whom he came in contact, among his
principal butts being M. Julien le Jeune de Paris,
as he dubbed himself; he had played his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
part in the French Revolution and had been
employed by Robespierre. This queer old
gentleman had perpetrated a considerable
quantity of fearful poetry, portions of which it
was his delight to recite. These effusions he
called “<cite lang="fr">Mes Chagrins</cite>,” and carried about with
him written out upon sheets of foolscap, which
peeped out modestly from the breast-pocket of
his coat. It was D’Orsay’s delight when M.
Julien visited Seamore Place to induce him to
recite a “<cite lang="fr">Chagrin</cite>,” the doing of which reduced
the old man to tears of sorrow and the listeners
to tears of laughter. One evening a large party
was assembled, among whom were M. Julien,
James Smith, Madden, and Dr Quin, a physician
whom young Mathews describes as “The ever
genial Dr Quin … inexhaustible flow of fun
and good-humour.” D’Orsay gravely begged
Julien to oblige the company, and overcame his
assumed reluctance, by the appeal—</p>

<p>“N’est ce pas Madden vous n’avez jamais
entendu les Chagrins politiques de notre cher ami,
Monsieur Julien?”</p>

<p>“Jamais,” Madden stammered out, stifling a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Allons, mon ami,” D’Orsay continued,
turning again to his victim, “ce pauvre Madden a
bien besoin d’entendre vos Chagrins politiques—il
a les siens aussi—il a souffert—lui—il a des
sympathies pour les blessés, il faut lui donner ce
triste plaisir—n’est ce pas, Madden?”</p>

<p>“Oui,” gurgled Madden.</p>

<p>Then the funereal fun began. Julien planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
himself at the upper end of the room, near to a
table upon which some wax candles were burning,
and drew forth his “<cite lang="fr">Chagrins</cite>” from his breast.
Lady Blessington seated herself at his left hand,
gazing solicitously into his face; at his other
hand stood D’Orsay, ever and anon pressing his
handkerchief to his eyes, and turning at one of
the saddest moments to Madden, and whispering,
“Pleurez donc!”</p>

<p>Quin, looking amazingly youthful, made his
appearance during a particularly melting “<cite lang="fr">Chagrin</cite>,”
wherein the author, supposed to be in chase
of capricious happiness, exclaimed:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Le bonheur! le voilà!</div>
<div class="verse">Ici! Ici! La! La!</div>
<div class="verse">En haut, en bas! En bas!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The doctor entered into the spirit of the affair,
and whenever D’Orsay acclaimed any passage,
would chime in with “Magnifique!” “Superbe!”
“Vraiment beau!”</p>

<p>The recital ended as usual in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>But D’Orsay was not yet contented, but must
be further plaguing the tearful old gentleman.
He whispered mysteriously to him, drawing his
attention to Quin and James Smith.</p>

<p>“Ah! Que c’est touchant!” exclaimed Julien.
“Ah! mon Dieu! Ce tendre amour filial comme
c’est beau! comme c’est touchant!”</p>

<p>Then D’Orsay went up to Quin, and to his
amazement said—</p>

<p>“Allez, mon ami, embrassez votre père!
Embrassez le, mon pauvre enfant,” then added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pointing to Smith, who was holding out his arms,
“C’est toujours comme ça, toujours comme ça, ce
pauvre garçon—avant le monde il a honte
d’embrasser son père.”</p>

<p>Quin took the cue; jumped from his chair,
and flung himself violently in Smith’s arms,
nearly upsetting the gouty old gentleman.
Locked in each other’s arms, they exclaimed—“Oh,
fortunate meeting! Oh, happy reconciliation!
Oh, fond father! Oh, affectionate son!”
while D’Orsay stood beside them overwhelmed
with emotion, Julien equally and really affected,
sobbing, gasping, and exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Ah! Mon Dieu! Que c’est touchant!
Pauvre jeune homme! Pauvre père!”</p>

<p>Lord William Pitt Lennox first met Louis
Napoleon at Seamore Place, also the Countess
Guiccioli:—</p>

<p>“My first acquaintance with Napoleon,” he
says, “was at an evening party at the Countess
of Blessington’s, in Seymour Place. On arriving
there my attention was attracted to two individuals,
whom I had never previously seen. The
one was a lady, who appeared to have numbered
nearly forty years, with the most luxuriant gold-coloured
hair, blue eyes and fresh complexion,
that I ever saw. The other a gentleman, who,
from the deference paid him, was evidently a distinguished
foreigner. Before I had time to ascertain
the name of the latter, a friend remarked: ‘How
handsome the Guiccioli is looking this evening!’</p>

<p>“‘Splendidly,’ I replied, as the idea flashed
across my mind that the <i lang="la">incognita</i> must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Byron’s ‘fair-haired daughter of Italia,’ Teresa
Gamba, Countess Guiccioli. ‘Do you know
Madame Guiccioli?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ responded my companion; ‘I met
her at Venice, and shall be delighted to present
you.…’”</p>

<p>“While conversing with the Guiccioli, Count
d’Orsay approached us, and, apologising for his
intrusion, said that Prince Louis Napoleon was
anxious to be introduced to me, with a view to
thanking me for my kind advice. Accordingly,
I took leave of madame, but not before I had
received her permission to call upon her at
Sablonière’s Hotel, in what the ordinary frequenters
of Leicester Square call ‘<i lang="fr">le plus beau
quartier de Londres</i>.’”</p>

<p>The advice referred to had come in a round-about
way to Louis Napoleon, and had reference
to the projected duel with Léon.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h2 id="XII">XII<br />
<span class="smaller">HANDSOME IS—</span></h2>

<p>What manner of man was D’Orsay at this period
of his life, when he was treading so gaily the
primrose way of pleasure as a man about London
town? What were his claims to the reputation
he gained as a dandy and a wit? How did he
appear to his contemporaries?</p>

<p>That he was generally liked and by many looked
on with something approaching to affection there
is ample evidence to prove. Was ever a social
sinner so beloved? Was dandy ever so trusted?</p>

<p>He was strikingly handsome in face and
figure, of that his portraits assure us. One
enthusiast tells us: “He was incomparably the
handsomest man of his time … uniting to a
figure scarcely inferior in the perfection of its
form to that of Apollo, a head and face that
blended the grace and dignity of the Antinous
with the beaming intellect of the younger
Bacchus, and the almost feminine softness and
beauty of the Ganymede.”</p>

<p>He was an adept in the mysteries of the toilet,
as careful of his complexion as a professional
<i lang="fr">belle</i>; revelling in perfumed baths; equipped with
an enormous dressing-case fitted in gold, as became
the prince of dandies, which he carried
everywhere, though it took two men to lift it.</p>

<p>As to clothes, he led the fashion by the nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and led it whithersoever he wished. He indulged
in extravagances, which he knew his reputation
and his figure could carry off, and then laughed
to see his satellites and toadies making themselves
ridiculous by adopting them. His tailor, Herr
Stultz, is reported to have proudly described
himself as “Tailor to M. le Comte d’Orsay,” full
well knowing that the recommendation of mere
royalty could carry no such weight. Where
D’Orsay led the way all men of fashion must
follow. Indeed, it was said that D’Orsay was
fully aware of the value of his patronage, and that
he expected his tailors to express substantial
gratitude for it. When clothes arrived at Seamore
Place, in the most mysterious manner banknotes
had found their way into their pockets. Once
when this accident had not happened, D’Orsay
bade his valet return the garment with the message
that “the lining of the pockets had been forgotten.”</p>

<p>The ordinary man, as regards his costume,
takes care about the main points and permits
the details to take care of themselves. Not so
your true dandy. Thus we find D’Orsay writing
to Banker Moritz Feist at Frankfort: “Will you
send me a dozen pair of gloves colour ‘feuille-morte,’
such as they have on sale at the Tyrolean
glove shops? They ought to fit your hand (that’s
a compliment!), and (this is a fib!) I’ll send along
the cash.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay was sometimes quite unkind when
friends spoke to him on the subject of some new
garment he was sporting.</p>

<p>Gronow meeting D’Orsay one day arrayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a vest of supreme originality, exclaimed: “My dear
Count, you really must give me that waistcoat.”</p>

<p>“Wiz pleasure, Nogrow,”—the Count’s comical
misrendering of Gronow’s name—“but what shall
you do wiz him? Aha! he shall make you an
dressing-gown.”</p>

<p>What the Count could carry off would have
extinguished the less-distinguished Gronow.</p>

<p>In Hyde Park, at the happy hour when all
“the world” assembled there, some driving, some
riding, some strolling, some leaning on the railings
and quizzing the passers-by, D’Orsay was to
be seen in all his glory. An afternoon lounge in
the Park was as delightful then as it is nowadays.</p>

<p>To quote Patmore:—</p>

<p>“See! what is this vision of the age of chivalry,
that comes careering towards us on horseback, in
the form of a stately cavalier, than whom nothing
has been witnessed in modern times more noble
in air and bearing, more splendid in person, more
<i lang="fr">distingué</i> in dress, more consummate in equestrian
skill, more radiant in intellectual expression, and
altogether more worthy and fitting to represent
one of those knights of the olden time, who
warred for truth and beauty, beneath the banner
of Cœur de Lion. It is Count D’Orsay.”</p>

<p>This language is as dazzling as the vision
itself must have been!</p>

<p>Writing of various fashions in horsemanship,
Sidney says:—</p>

<p>“As late as 1835 it was the fashion for the
swells or dandies of the period—Count d’Orsay,
the Earl of Chesterfield, and their imitators—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tittup along the streets and in the Park with their
toes just touching the stirrups, which hung three
inches lower than in the hunting-field.”</p>

<p>Abraham Hayward rode in the Park with
D’Orsay in March 1838, “to the admiration of all
beholders, for every eye is sure to be fixed upon
him, and the whole world was out, so that I
began to tremble for my character.”</p>

<p>Here is another contemporary account, which
deals rather with the outer habit than with
knight-like man:—</p>

<p>“From the colour and tie of the kerchief
which adorned his neck, to the spurs ornamenting
the heels of his patent boots, he was the original
for countless copyists, particularly and collectively.
The hue and cut of his many faultless coats, the
turn of his closely-fitting inexpressibles, the shade
of his gloves, the knot of his scarf, were studied
by the motley multitude with greater interest and
avidity than objects more profitable and worthy of
their regard, perchance, could possibly hope to
obtain. Nor did the beard that flourished
luxuriantly upon the delicate and nicely-chiselled
features of the Marquis (Count) escape the
universal imitation. Those who could not cultivate
their scanty crops into the desirable arrangement,
had recourse to art and stratagem to supply
the natural deficiency.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay was indeed the Prince of the Dandies,
it might be more truthfully said, the Tyrant.
What he did and wore, they must do and wear;
the cut of his coat and the cut of his hair, the
arrangement of his tie—the Prince could do no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
wrong. Of this sincere form of flattery a comical
tale is told. Riding back to town one day, as
usual capitally mounted, D’Orsay was overtaken
by a downpour of rain. The groom, who usually
carried an overcoat for his master, had this day
forgotten to bring it. D’Orsay was equal to this
as to most occasions. He spied a sailor who
wore a long, heavy waistcoat which kept him snug.</p>

<p>“Hullo, friend,” called out D’Orsay, pulling up,
“would you like to go into that inn and drink to
my health until the rain’s over?”</p>

<p>The sailor was naturally enough somewhat surprised,
and asked D’Orsay why he was chaffing him.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said D’Orsay, dismounting and
going into the inn, followed by the sailor, “but I
want your vest, sell it me.”</p>

<p>He took out and offered the poor devil ten
guineas, assuring him at the same time that he
“could buy another after the rain was over.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay put on the vest over his coat,
buttoned it from top to bottom, remounted and
rode on to town.</p>

<p>The rain passed over, the sun came out again,
and as it was the proper hour to show himself in
Hyde Park, D’Orsay showed himself.</p>

<p>“How original! How charming! How
delicious!” cried the elegant dandies, astonished
by D’Orsay’s new garment, “only a D’Orsay could
have thought of such a creation!”</p>

<p>The next day dandies similarly enveloped were
“the thing,” and thus the paletot was invented.</p>

<p>An anecdote is told, with what authority or
want of it we do not know, by the Comtesse de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Basanville, bearing upon D’Orsay’s good nature.
One day out riding he stopped at an inn, took out
a cigar, and was going to call out for a light, when
a lad who came out of the tavern, offered him the
match with which he had been going to light his
own pipe. D’Orsay, who was struck by the boy’s
politeness and good looks, began to chat with him.</p>

<p>“From what country do you come?”</p>

<p>“From Wales, my lord.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t mind leaving your mountains
for the smoky streets of London?”</p>

<p>“I’d go back without minding at all,” answered
the boy, “but poor folk can’t do what they want,
and God knows when I’ll be going back to my
old mother who’s crying and waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“You’re ambitious then?”</p>

<p>“I want to get bread. I’m young and strong,
and work’s better paid in London than at home.
That’s why I’ve come.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said D’Orsay, “I’d like to help you
make your fortune. Here’s a guinea for your
match. To-morrow, come to Hyde Park when
the promenade is full; bring with you a box of
matches, and when you see me with a lot of people
round me, come up and offer me your ware.”</p>

<p>Naturally enough the boy turned up at the
right hour and the right place.</p>

<p>“Who’ll buy my matches,” he called out.</p>

<p>“Aha! It’s you,” said D’Orsay. “Give me
one quick to light my cigar.”</p>

<p>Another guinea—and the Count said carelessly
to those grouped around him—</p>

<p>“Just imagine, that I couldn’t smoke a cigar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which is not lit with one of this boy’s matches—others
seem to me horrible.”</p>

<p>No sooner hinted than done; off went the
matches and down came the guineas, and
addresses even were given for delivery of a
further supply.</p>

<p>Even if this story be not true, it is characteristic.</p>

<p>One other story of his power.</p>

<p>A certain peer quarrelled violently with him;
result, a duel. It was pointed out to the unfortunate
gentleman that if D’Orsay fought with him
it would become the fashion to do so! When
D’Orsay heard of his adversary’s urgent reason
for wishing not to meet him, he agreed readily
that it was reasonable, and the affair was
arranged. D’Orsay laughingly added: “It’s
lucky I’m a Frenchman and don’t suffer from the
dumps. If I cut my throat, to-morrow there’d
be three hundred suicides in London, and for a time
at any rate the race of dandies would disappear.”</p>

<p>By Greville we are informed that D’Orsay was
“tolerably well-informed,” which surely must be
the judgment of jealousy.</p>

<p>In manner and habits D’Orsay grew to be
thoroughly English, no small feat, while retaining
all the vivacity, <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>, and “little arts” of
the Frenchman. But he does not seem ever to
have acquired a perfect English accent; Willis in
1835 says of him, he “still speaks the language
with a very slight accent, but with a choice of
words that shows him to be a man of uncommon
tact and elegance of mind.” The language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the waistcoats of those dandy days were alike
flowery.</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide, the evidence being
scanty, whether or not D’Orsay was a wit of
eminence, or a mere humorist. Chorley the
musical critic, or rather the critic of music, said
that his wit “was more quaint than anything I
have heard from Frenchmen (there are touches
of like quality in Rabelais), more airy than the
brightest London wit of my time, those of Sydney
Smith and Mr Fonblanque not excepted.” It was
a kindly wit, too, which counts for grace. It is
not unlikely that the broken English which he
knew well how to use to the best advantage
helped to add a sense of comicality to remarks
otherwise not particularly amusing; just as Lamb
found his stammer of assistance.</p>

<p>A little wit carried off with a radiant manner
goes a long way, and we are inclined to believe
that D’Orsay on account of his good-humoured
chaff and laughing impertinences gained a reputation
for a higher wit than he really possessed.
True wit raises only a smile, sometimes a rather
wry one; humour forces us to break out into
laughter such as apparently usually accompanied
D’Orsay’s sallies. The following is preserved for
us by Gronow, who held that D’Orsay’s conversation
was original and amusing, but “more humour
and <i lang="fr">à propos</i> than actual wit.” Tom Raikes,
whose face was badly marked by small-pox, for
some reason or other, wrote D’Orsay an anonymous
letter, and sealed it, using something like the
top of a thimble for the purpose. D’Orsay found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
out who was the writer of the epistle, and accosted
him with—“Ha! ha! my good Raikes, the next
time you write an anonymous letter, you must not
seal it with your nose!”—looking at that pock-pitted
organ. Which is more facetious than witty.</p>

<p>Here is another story of a somewhat similar
character, kindly provided me by Mr Charles
Brookfield:—“My father once met D’Orsay at
breakfast. After the meal was over and the
company were lounging about the fireplace, a
singularly tactless gentleman of the name of
Powell crept up behind the Count, and twitching
suddenly a hair out of the back of his head
exclaimed: ‘Excuse me, Count, one solitary
white hair!’ D’Orsay contrived to conceal his
annoyance, but bided his time. Very soon he
found his chance and approaching Mr Powell he
deliberately plucked a hair from his head, exclaiming,
‘Parrdon, Pow-ail, one solitary <em>black</em> ’air.’”</p>

<p>Gronow also tells this. “Lord Allen, none
the better for drink, was indulging in some rough
rather than ready chaff at D’Orsay’s expense.
When John Bush came in, d’Orsay greeted him
cordially, exclaiming: ‘<i lang="fr">Voilà la différence entre
une bonne bouche et une mauvaise haleine</i>.’”</p>

<p>D’Orsay, Lord William Pitt Lennox and
“King” Allen were invited to dinner at the
house of a Jewish millionaire, and the first-named
promised to call for the other two.</p>

<p>“We shall be late,” grumbled Allen. “You’re
never in time, D’Orsay.”</p>

<p>“You shall see,” answered D’Orsay, unruffled,
and drove off at a fine pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Even though they arrived in time Allen was
not appeased, and grumbled at everything and
everybody, and the cup of his wrath hopelessly
overflowed when he overheard one of the servants
saying to another:</p>

<p>“The gents are come.”</p>

<p>“Gents,” snorted Allen. “Gents! What a
wretched low fellow! It’s worthy of a public-house!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Allen, it is quite correct.
The man is a Jew. He means to say the
Gentiles have arrived. Gent is the short for
Gentile!”</p>

<p>Landor writes in June 1840: “I sat at dinner
(at Gore House) by Charles Forester, Lady
Chesterfield’s brother. In the last hunting season
Lord Chesterfield, wanting to address a letter to
him, and not knowing exactly where to find him,
gave it to D’Orsay to direct it. He directed it—Charles
Forester, one field before the hounds,
Melton Mowbray. Lord Alvanley took it, and
(he himself told me) gave it to him on the very
spot.” Landor goes on to speak of meeting a lady
who accosted him with: “Sure, Landor, it is a
beautiful book, your <cite>Periwinkle and Asparagus</cite>!”</p>

<p>But surely the most delightful thing D’Orsay
ever said was on the occasion of a visit of him to
Lady Blessington’s publishers, whom he rated in
high language.</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay,” said a solemn personage in
a high, white neckcloth, “I would sooner lose
Lady Blessington’s patronage than submit to
such personal abuse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is nothing personal,” retorted D’Orsay,
suavely. “If you are Otley, then damn Saunders;
if you are Saunders, then damn Otley.”</p>

<p>Edward Barrington de Fonblanque, nephew
of Albany, records that D’Orsay was a capital
<i lang="fr">raconteur</i>, with an inexhaustible stock of stories,
which he retailed “in a manner irresistibly droll.”
One of these anecdotes ran thus:—</p>

<p>Méhémet Ali asked of a Frenchman what was
a republic.</p>

<p>The reply was—</p>

<p>“Si l’Egypte était une république, vous seriez
le peuple et le peuple serait le Pacha.”</p>

<p>Méhémet responded that he could not summon
up “aucun goût, aucune sympathie, pour une
république.”</p>

<p>Madden says: “A mere report would be in
vain, of the <i lang="fr">bons mots</i> he uttered, without a faithful
representation of his quiet, imperturbable manner—his
arch look, the command of varied emphasis
in his utterance, the anticipatory indications of
coming drollery in the expression of his countenance—the
power of making his <i lang="fr">entourage</i> enter
into his thoughts, and his success in prefacing his
<i lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i> by significant glances and gestures,
suggestive of ridiculous ideas.”</p>

<p>To turn to another essential of the equipment of
a complete dandy, D’Orsay was an accomplished
<i lang="fr">gourmet</i>. This gift must have added greatly to
his usefulness in Lady Blessington’s establishment,
where doubtless he was master of the
<i lang="fr">menus</i>. Other folk also availed themselves of
his skill in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>We quote from that staid depository of learning,
<cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>, from an article published
in 1835 and written by Abraham Hayward:—</p>

<p>“It seems allowed on all hands that a first-rate
dinner in England is out of all comparison
better than a dinner of the same class in any
other country; for we get the best cooks, as we
get the best singers and dancers, by bidding
highest for them, and we have cultivated certain
national dishes to a point which makes them the
envy of the world. In proof of this bold assertion,
which is backed, moreover, by the unqualified
admission of Ude, we request attention to the
<i lang="fr">menu</i> of the dinner given in May last to Lord
Chesterfield, on his quitting the office of Master
of the Buckhounds, at the Clarendon. The party
consisted of thirty; the price was six guineas a
head; and the dinner was ordered by Comte
d’Orsay, who stands without a rival amongst
connoisseurs in this department of art:—</p>

Green goose, also, may rank as English, the goose
being held in little honour, with the exception of
its liver, by the French; but we think Comte
d’Orsay did quite right in inserting it.… The
moderation of the price must strike everyone.”</p>

<p>The Clarendon Hotel was situated in Bond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Street and Albemarle Street, and with Mivart’s
in Brook Street shared the reputation of being
the best hotel in town, holding the premier place
for dining in luxury and elegance.</p>

<p>In the later Gore House days D’Orsay must
have been sorely vexed, though he showed it not
openly, at a mishap at a dinner given by Lady
Blessington and himself. It is best told in the
words of one who was present:—</p>

<p>“I well remember a dinner at Lady Blessington’s,
when an event occurred that proved how
ready the <i lang="fr">Cupidon déchainé</i>, as Byron called him,
was to extricate himself from any difficulty. The
party consisted of ten, and out of them there were
about six who enjoyed what is called a glass of
wine, meaning a bottle. Before dinner the Count
had alluded to some splendid Clicquot champagne
and claret of celebrated vintage. While we were
waiting to sit down, D’Orsay was more than once
called out of the room, and a quick-sighted individual
hinted to me that he feared some unpleasant
visitors of the dun family were importunate for
some ‘small account.’ Still, there was nothing
on the light-hearted Frenchman’s face to show
that he was at all put out. Dinner was announced,
and all promised to go well, as the soup and the
fish were unexceptionable, when my quick-sighted
friend, who was a great <i lang="fr">gourmet</i>, remarked that
he saw no champagne. ‘Perhaps,’ I replied,
<i lang="it">sotto voce</i>, ‘it is being kept in ice outside.’ The
sherry was handed round, and repeated looks
passed between the hostess and the Count, and
between the same and the head servant. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<i lang="fr">entrées</i> were handed round, and a thirsty soul,
with rather bad tact, for he was too gentlemanlike
to be deficient in taste, asked in an undertone
for a glass of champagne. The servant
looked confused; D’Orsay saw it, and exclaimed
aloud: ‘No champagne to-day; my Lady and I
have a treat for you—a royal treat. You know
that the Queen has lately patronised what is
called the Balmoral brose, and here is some.’
At this moment one of the servants entered with
a large jug containing this Scotch delicacy, which,
of course, following the example of our hostess,
we all declared to be excellent. ‘Far better than
wine,’ said the late Lord Pembroke, a sentiment,
I need scarcely say, in which the rest did not
agree. Balmoral brose did duty for champagne
and claret, and the only wine upon that memorable
occasion was sherry. Whether the butler
was absent without leave, or the key of the cellar
lost or mislaid, or, as was hinted by my neighbour
at dinner, the wine merchant had been seized
with a sudden fit of hard-heartedness, I know
not. All I do know is, that a mixture of Highland
whisky and honey was substituted for the
foaming grape of eastern France.”</p>

<p>“Foaming grape” is good! Not good, however,
is the taste left by this anecdote; a party of
well-to-do men dining with D’Orsay and Lady
Blessington, and cracking jokes behind their backs
at their impecuniosity.</p>

<p>D’Orsay was once dining with his brother
dandy Disraeli, and was grieved by the undoubted
fact that the dishes were served up distinctly cool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
But the climax was reached when tepid ices were
brought forward.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed D’Orsay, “at
last we have got something hot!”</p>

<p>As a matter of course the circumstances in which
he was so ostentatiously living and his general reputation
kept D’Orsay outside the houses of those
who did not open their doors to everybody, though
most male folk were pleased enough to visit him
and Lady Blessington at Seamore Place, where of
womankind, however, none except relatives and
exotics were to be met with. But even a dandy
must find occasionally a crumpled rose-leaf in his
bed. But what counted this exclusion against the
having been spoken of by young Ben Dizzy as
“the most delightful of men and best of friends,”
and by Victor Prévost, Viscount d’Arlincourt, as
“<i lang="fr">le roi de la grâce et du goût</i>”?</p>

<p>It took much to disturb D’Orsay’s serenity
and peace of mind; he was one of those blessed
beings, whom all we poor miserable sinners must
envy, who did not own to a conscience. Certainly
the being head over ears in debt did not cause
him a moment’s anxiety. He did not realise that
money had any value; guineas to him were
simply counters of which it was convenient to
have a sufficient supply wherewith to pay gambling
debts and to discharge the incidental ready-money
expenditure of each day. As for other
expenses, were not tradesmen honoured by his
custom, were they not a race of slaves ordained
to supply the necessities of noble men such as
D’Orsay, was it not a scandal that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
dare to ask him to pay his bills? What pleasure
is there in the bills we pay? D’Orsay never
denied himself anything which he could obtain
for love or by owing money. It has even been
said of him—and what will not little men say of
even the greatest?—that he was “unscrupulous
and indelicate about money matters.” How poor-spirited
the creature who could ask such a man
as D’Orsay to pay back the money he had lent
him or to render their due to the tailors and such
like whom he had honoured with his patronage!
The spirit of a D’Orsay cannot be appreciated
rightly save by one of kindred genius. Who that
was worthy to be his friend would not feel
honoured by a request from him for a loan,
and injured by even a hint at repayment? Of
what value is a rich friend if he will not be your
banker?</p>

<p>D’Orsay’s finances from now onward were in
a state of hopeless chaos, from which the efforts
of his friends signally failed to extricate him.
Which failure, however, in the long run cannot
have made any difference; to have hauled him
out of his ocean of debt would only have landed him
for a brief space upon dry land, whereon he would
have gasped like a fish out of water; he was a born
debtor. His marriage had replenished, or rather
filled, his exchequer; then he proceeded with skill
and rapidity to empty it. Why should not a colourless
wife contribute to the support of a resplendent
husband? Yet, marvellous, almost incredible, there
were carping and jealous spirits who boggled over
this and other transactions of Count d’Orsay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>As for instance Patmore, commenting on
D’Orsay’s social difficulties, writes:—</p>

<p>“And yet it was in England, that Count
d’Orsay while a mere boy, made the fatal mistake
of marrying one beautiful woman, while he was,
without daring to confess it even to himself,
madly in love with another, still more beautiful,
whom he could not marry—because, I say, under
these circumstances, and discovering his fatal
error when too late, he separated himself from
his wife almost at the church door, he was, during
the greatest part of his social career in England,
cut off from the advantages of the more fastidious
portion of female society, by the indignant fiat
of its heads and leaders.”</p>

<p>There are quite a wonderful number of
blunders in the above meandering sentences.</p>

<p>True as it was that he was cut by “the more
fastidious portion of female society,” D’Orsay found
consolation, sympathy and understanding—doubtless
also advice and counsel—in the comradeship
of Lady Blessington—and others. Grantley
Berkeley tells us that D’Orsay “was as fickle as a
French lover might be expected to be to a woman
some years his senior.” In which sneer there is
a smack of insular envy. On the other hand
Dickens, the exponent of the middle-class
conscience, wrote of him as one “whose gentle
heart even a world of fashion left unspoiled!” How
can history be written with any approach to truth
when contemporary evidence differs so widely?
Was D’Orsay a saint or a sinner? Who dare say?</p>

<p>Society gossiped evilly about him, as it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
do about anyone and everyone, telling tales that
did not redound to his credit. The Duchesse de
Dino retails this, under date February 20th,
1834:—</p>

<p>“A new and very ugly story is afloat concerning
Count Alfred d’Orsay, which is as follows:
Sir Willoughby Cotton, writing from Brighton at
the same time to Count d’Orsay and to Lady
Fitzroy Somerset, cross-directed the letters so
that M. d’Orsay on opening the letter which he
received, instead of seeing the mistake and
stopping at the first line, which ran ‘Dear Lady
Fitzroy,’ read it through and found, among other
Brighton gossip, some pleasantries about Lady
Tullemore and one of her lovers, and a sharp saying
about himself. What did he do but go to the
club, read out the letter before every one, and
finally put it under cover and send it to Lord
Tullemore! The result very nearly was a crop
of duels. Lady Tullemore is very ill, and the
guilty lover has fled to Paris. Friends intervened,
however, and the thing was hushed up
for the sake of the ladies, but M. d’Orsay cut
(and cuts) an odious figure.”</p>

<p>Such a story disgraces those who tell it, not
him of whom it is told. D’Orsay guilty of hurting
a woman’s reputation, directly or indirectly?
The idea is absurd! Of a man too who was a
philanthropist and one of the founders of the
Société de Bienfaisance in London!</p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A LONDON SALON</span></h2>

<p>What have been the causes of the decline and
fall in London of the <i lang="fr">salon</i> as a social and sociable
institution? It is a difficult question to answer.
Our hostesses are as lovely, as charming, as
cultured and as hospitable to-day as ever they
were; our men as gallant and as fond of feminine
society; where then lurked the seeds of decay?</p>

<p>A successful <i lang="fr">salon</i> depended upon the
brilliancy of the conversation of those who
frequented it; a <i lang="fr">salon</i> without wit would be as a
pond without water, or a sky at night empty of
stars. Conversation is a lost art. Talk we have
in superabundance, also argument. But the light
give and take, the prompt wit, the ready repartee,
which form the mainstay of a conversation, are
now all so rare that it would be impossible to
gather together anything like a company of true
masters and mistresses of conversation. The
finest conversation to-day is heard among those
who do not frequent the drawing-rooms of the
leaders of fashion. Moreover, in those bygone
days men of fashion were expected to be also
men of wit and of culture; now-a-days men are
rated at cheque-value not at brain-value, more’s
the pity. D’Orsay would be hopelessly at sea in
London society to-day, not on account of his
morals, but because he would not be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
contribute his share of unconsidered and platitudinous
trifles at tea-fights, over-lengthy dinners
and over-crowded dances.</p>

<p>In the London of D’Orsay’s prime the <i lang="fr">salon</i>
was still a power for pleasure, and he and Lady
Blessington reigned over that which was perhaps
the most brilliant that our country has ever seen.
There were others. That at Holland House, for
example, where Lady Holland reigned supreme
and somewhat severe. To that select circle, from
which he was now, alas, excluded, D’Orsay had
been admitted when as a mere youth he first
visited London. Dining there one day, he was
honoured by a seat next his hostess, who apparently
looked upon the young Frenchman as
sure to be awe-stricken by her presence. She did
not know her man. Time and again she allowed
her napkin to slip down to the floor, on each
occasion asking D’Orsay to recover it for her.
This exercise at last exhausted his patience, and
when the “accident” occurred again he startled
her haughtiness by saying, “<i lang="fr">Ne ferais-je pas
mieux, madame, de m’asseoir sous la table, afin de
pouvoir vous passer la serviette plus rapidement?</i>”</p>

<p>Lady Holland had been a wealthy Miss
Vassall, and deserted her first husband, Sir
Godfrey Webster, at the charming of Lord
Holland. The latter has been described as “the
last and the best of the Whigs of the old school,”
and was a man of highly cultivated mind, of
genial hospitality, of wit, and a master of the art
of conversation. Among the frequenters of the
Holland House circle were Tom Moore, Macaulay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Lord John Russell, to mention three men of very
different character. D’Orsay, in what is perchance
a stray relic of that famous Journal of his,
gives this picture of Lord Holland:—“It is impossible
to know Lord Holland without feeling
for him a strong sentiment of affection; he has
so much goodness of heart, that one forgets often
the superior qualities of mind which distinguish
him; and it is difficult to conceive that a man so
simple, so natural and so good, should be one of
the most distinguished senators of our days.”
Lady Holland had not shown her best self to
D’Orsay; she was a despot, but benevolent in the
use of her power and full of the milk of human
kindness.</p>

<p>That D’Orsay was fully equipped to king it
over a <i lang="fr">salon</i> frequented by distinguished men is
evident; no less was Lady Blessington endowed
with all the requisites to reign as queen. The
gift of all gifts to a woman, beauty, was hers in
a high degree. Willis thus describes her:—</p>

<p>“Her person is full, but preserves all the fineness
of an admirable shape; her foot is not
pressed in a satin slipper for which a Cinderella
might long be sought in vain; and her complexion
(an unusually fair skin, with very dark
hair and eyebrows) is of even a girlish delicacy
and freshness. Her dress, of blue satin … was
cut low, and folded across her bosom, in a way to
show to advantage the round and sculpture-like
curve and whiteness of a pair of exquisite
shoulders, while her hair, dressed close to her
head, and parted simply on her forehead with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
rich <i lang="fr">ferronier</i> of turquoise, enveloped in clear outline
a head with which it would be difficult to find
a fault. Her features are regular, and her mouth,
the most expressive of them, has a ripe fullness
and freedom of play peculiar to the Irish
physiognomy, and expressive of the most unsuspicious
good-humour. Add to all this, a voice
merry and sad by turns, but always musical, and
manners of the most unpretending elegance, yet
even more remarkable for their winning kindness,
and you have the prominent traits of one of the
most lovely and fascinating women I have ever
seen.”</p>

<p>In these years her conversation was full of
frank spontaneity; a smile always hovered round
her lips, and there was not mingled with her wit
any spite of malice. She expressed herself with
felicity, though not in any studied manner, and
accompanied her words with expressive looks and
gestures. Above all, she understood that conversation
is a game of give and take, “one <i lang="fr">bon
mot</i> followed another, without pause or effort, for
a minute or two, and then, while her wit and
humour were producing their desired effect, she
would take care, by an apt word or gesture,
provocative of mirth and communicativeness, to
draw out the persons who were best fitted to
shine in company, and leave no intelligence, however
humble, without affording it an opportunity
and encouragement to make some display, even
in a single trite remark, a telling observation in
the course of conversation.”</p>

<p>The evening at Seamore Place often began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with a dinner party; some of these it will be
pleasant for us to attend, in a proper spirit.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Habitués</i> not only dined there, but when so
disposed dropped in of an evening at almost any
hour. Tom Moore records in his memoirs that
he did so on 17th December 1833:—“Went to
Lady Blessington’s, having heard that she is at
home most evenings. Found her gay rooms
splendidly lighted up, and herself in a similar
state of illumination, sitting ‘alone in her glory,’
reading. It was like the solitude of some princess
confined in a fairy palace. After I had been a
few minutes with her, however, D’Orsay made his
appearance. Stayed about three-quarters of an
hour conversing.…”</p>

<p>Then on 11th August of the following year he
“Dined at Lady Blessington’s: company, D’Orsay
(as master of the house), John Ponsonby, Willis
the American, Count Pahlen (whom I saw a good
deal of when he was formerly in London, and
liked), Fonblanque, the editor of <cite>The Examiner</cite>,
and a foreigner, whose name I forget. Sat next
to Fonblanque, and was glad of the opportunity
of knowing him. A clever fellow certainly, and
with great powers occasionally as a writer. Got
on very well together.”</p>

<p>That must have been a pleasant gathering:
a witty hostess, a witty host, and several other
wits, Fonblanque among them, of whom Lytton
speaks enthusiastically to Lady Blessington:
“What a combination to reconcile one to mankind,
and <em>such</em> honour, <em>such</em> wisdom and <em>such</em> genius.”
Albany Fonblanque, as so many others have done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
deserted law for journalism, achieving a high degree
of success as editor of <cite>The Examiner</cite>. He was a
master of sarcasm. Before Dickens set out on his
first trip to America, in 1842, Fonblanque cuttingly
said: “Why, aren’t there disagreeable people
enough to describe in Blackburn or Leeds?”</p>

<p>In the same year (1834) Benjamin Disraeli
was one of a distinguished company entertained
one night in May:—“On Monday I dined with
Lady Blessington, the Prince of Moskowa,
Charles Lafitte, Lords Castlereagh, Elphinstone,
and Allen, Mr Talbot, myself.…” Disraeli in
his thirtieth year was a man after D’Orsay’s heart,
a fellow dandy and a brother wit. But there
was a difference in kind: Disraeli was an
amateur, D’Orsay a professional; to the former
dandyism was a pose, of his life a thing apart, it
was the latter’s whole existence; dandyism with
Disraeli was part of a means to an end, with
D’Orsay it was the end itself. The useful Willis
gives a description of Disraeli at somewhere
about this date, but Madden casts a doubt upon
his accuracy. It was a strange scene, like pages
torn from <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, and from what we learn
from other sources the “atmosphere” at any rate
is correct and typical:—</p>

<p>“Disraeli had arrived before me at Lady
Blessington’s,” Willis writes, “and sat in the
deep window, looking out upon Hyde Park,
with the last rays of daylight reflected from the
gorgeous gold flowers of an embroidered waistcoat.
Patent leather pumps, a white stick, with
a black cord and tassel, and a quantity of chains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
about his neck and pockets, served to make him,
even in the dim light, rather a conspicuous object.
Disraeli has one of the most remarkable faces I
ever saw. He is lividly pale, and, but for the
energy of his action and the strength of his
lungs, would seem a victim to consumption.
His eye is black as Erebus, and has the most
mocking and lying-in-wait sort of expression
conceivable.… His hair is as extraordinary
as his taste in waistcoats. A thick heavy mass
of jet-black ringlets falls over his left cheek
almost to his collarless stock; while on the
right it is parted and put away with the smooth
carefulness of a girl, and shines most unctuously,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘With thy incomparable oil, Macassar.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Disraeli was the only one at table who knew
Beckford, and the style in which he gave a
sketch of his habits and manners was worthy of
himself. I might as well attempt to gather up
the foam of the sea, as to convey an idea of the
extraordinary language in which he clothed his
description. There were, at least, five words in
every sentence that must have been very much
astonished at the use they were put to, and yet
no others apparently could so well have conveyed
his idea. He talked like a race-horse
approaching the winning-post, every muscle in
action, and the utmost energy of expression
flung out in every burst. Victor Hugo and his
extraordinary novels came next under discussion;
and Disraeli, who was fired with his own
eloquence, started off <i lang="fr">apropos de bottes</i>, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
long story of empalement he had seen in Upper
Egypt. It was as good, and perhaps as
authentic, as the description of the chow-chow-tow
in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>. The circumstantiality of
the account was equally horrible and amusing.
Then followed the sufferer’s history, with a
score of murders and barbarities heaped together
like Martin’s feast of Belshazzar, with a mixture
of horror and splendour that was unparalleled in
my experience of improvisation. No mystic
priest of the Corybantes could have worked himself
up into a finer frenzy of language.”</p>

<p>Willis himself seems to have been bitten with
this fine frenzy.</p>

<p>Madden says that it was Disraeli’s wont to
be reserved and silent in company, but that
when he was aroused “his command of language
was truly wonderful, his power of sarcasm
unsurpassed.”</p>

<p>Disraeli apparently met D’Orsay for the first
time in February 1832, at a <i lang="fr">réunion</i> at Bulwer’s
house, and he describes him as “the famous
Parisian dandy.” They quickly struck up a
friendship. It is easy to understand what a
fascinating study D’Orsay must have offered to
Disraeli. We hear of the latter, a few months
after his marriage, entertaining Lyndhurst,
Bulwer, and D’Orsay. And in the spring of
1835 there was a party at Lyndhurst’s at 25
George Street, at which Disraeli and d’Orsay
were present. One of the company was wearing
a waistcoat of splendour exceptional even for
those splendid days. Said Disraeli as he entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the room: “What a beautiful pattern! Where
did you find it?” Then as the guests with one
accord displayed their vests, the host exclaimed:
“By the way, this brings to my mind a very
curious suit I had about a waistcoat, in which I
was counsel for a Jew, and won his case.” And
the story? It is lost! As hopelessly as the
story of “Ould Grouse in the Gun-room.”</p>

<p>After dinner some of the party went on to the
Opera to hear <cite>La Sonnambula</cite>, that rickety old
piece of fireworks; in an opposite box sat Lady
Blessington, “not very young, somewhat florid, but
effectively arranged in a turban, <i lang="fr">à la Joséphine</i>.”</p>

<p>Of the evening of 30th March 1835, Crabb
Robinson notes: “At half-past seven went to
Lady Blessington’s, where I dined. The
amusing man of the party was a young Irishman—Lover—a
miniature painter and an author.
He sang and accompanied himself, and told
some Irish tales with admirable effect.…
Among other guests were Chorley and the
American Willis. Count d’Orsay, of course, did
the honours. Did not leave till near one.…”</p>

<p>Lord Lyndhurst was a frequent visitor to
Seamore Place. Henry Fothergill Chorley was
well-known and respected in his day as a musical
critic, as a novelist neither respected nor famous;
he was a close friend of D’Orsay. A rude
journalist once spoke of “the Chorleys and the
<em>chawbacons</em> of literature.” An intimate friend
describes him as “doing all sorts of good and
generous deeds in a quiet, unostentatious way.”
Samuel Lover is best represented by his ballad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of “Rory O’More,” and <cite>Handy Andy</cite> still finds
a few readers.</p>

<p>William Archer Shee met Lover under somewhat
similar circumstances at another house:—“He
is a man who shines much in a small
circle. There is a brilliancy of thought, a general
versatility of talent about him that makes his
society very charming … he is one of the best
<i lang="fr">raconteurs</i> that ever kept an audience in a roar.
He told two Irish stories with the most racy
humour.”</p>

<p>The Blessington of course often showed herself
at the Opera, which then as now was a
fashionable lounge for musical and unmusical
folk. Writing to the Countess Guiccioli in
August 1833, she says:—“Our Opera has been
brilliant, and offered a galaxy of talent, such
as we never had before. Pasta, Malibran,
Tamburini, Rubini, Donzelli, and a host of
minor stars, with a <i lang="fr">corps de ballet</i>, with Taglioni
at their head, who more than redeemed their
want of excellency. I did not miss a single
night.…”</p>

<span class="smaller">ROUND THE TOWN</span></h2>

<p>D’Orsay was able to be almost anything to any
man, or any woman. He was highly accomplished
in every art of pleasing, and endowed
with the ability not only to enjoy himself but to
be the cause of enjoyment in others. He was
popular undoubtedly, wonderfully so, and with a
wide and varied range of men and women. But
there were also many who despised him, looking
askance at one who so openly defied the most
sacred conventions of society, and who, in many
ways, was accounted a mere adventurer. His
money transactions with his friends will not bear
scrutiny. Yet when all is said, he counted among
the multitude of his friends and admirers such men
as Bulwer, Landor, Lamartine, Dickens, Byron,
Disraeli and Lyndhurst. John Forster warmed
to him, and said that his “pleasantry, wit and
kindliness gave him a wonderful fascination.”</p>

<p>What did life mean to D’Orsay? Being a
wise man he looked upon the world as a place of
pleasant sojourning, of which it was the whole
duty of man to make the very best. That there
was, or might be, “another and a better world”
was no sort of excuse for being miserable in this
one. “<i lang="fr">Vive la joie!</i>” was his motto, and he
lived up to it gloriously. Life was meant to be
lived; money was made for spending; credit was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a device for obtaining good things for which the
obtainer had not any means or intention of
paying. No one but a fool would lift the cup of
pleasure to his lips and then set it down before
he had drained it dry. D’Orsay looked upon the
externals of a luxurious life, and found them very
pleasant. The Spartans pointed out the drunken
helot to their children, as a warning against
tippling. So we may hold out to our young
men the life of D’Orsay as an example of what
they should all endeavour to be, and as a warning
against the sheer foolishness of taking life
seriously. This is a degenerate age.</p>

<p>Exceptional as he was in so many ways,
D’Orsay was not unique. He had his doleful
dumps and his hours of bitterness; he was, after
all, a great <em>man</em>, not a petty god. He plucked
the roses of life so recklessly that he experienced
the sharpness of the thorns, which must often
have pierced deep. The conqueror as he tosses
uneasily in his sleep is assailed by dreams that
terrify. D’Orsay in his hours of greatest triumph
must sometimes have asked what would be the
end of his career; when would come his Waterloo
and St Helena? His thoughts must have sometimes
turned toward the young girl he had
married so light-heartedly, whose fortune he had
squandered, and whose life he had shadowed.
Success has its hours of remorse. Life is a
riddle; but D’Orsay was not often so foolish as
to bother his brains or break his heart over the
solution of it; let it solve itself as far as he was
concerned. If to-morrow were destined to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
overcast let not that possible mischance darken
the sunshine of to-day. Sufficient for the day are
the pleasures thereof.</p>

<p>There was not a pleasure or extravagance to
which he did not indulge himself to the full;
wine, women and song were all at his command;
he sported with love, and gambled with fortunes.
It was his ambition and his attainment to set the
pace in all pursuits of folly. Did a dancer take
the fancy of the town, D’Orsay must catch her
fancy and be her lover, in gossipings always and
when he so desired it in fact also.</p>

<p>There is not much doubt that D’Orsay followed
irreligiously the following directions for sowing
wild oats and cultivating exotics:—</p>

<p>“Rake discreetly beds of <i lang="fr">coryphées</i>—plant out
chorus-singers in park villas and Montpelier
cottages—refresh <i lang="fr">premières danseuses</i> with champagne
and chicken at the Star and Garter, Richmond,
varied with cold punch and white-bait at
the Crown and Sceptre, Blackwall—air <i lang="it">prima
donnas</i> in new broughams up and down Rotten
Row—carefully bind up rising actresses with
diamond rings and pearl tiaras, from Hancock’s—pot
ballet-dancers in dog-carts—trail slips of
columbines to box-seat in four-horse drag—support
fairies running to seed by props from
Fortnum &amp; Mason’s—leave to dry Apollos that
have done blooming, and cut Don Giovannis that
throw out too many suckers.”</p>

<p>Another famous tavern at Blackwall was Lovegrove’s
“The Brunswick,” where the white-bait
was a famous dish. Of this excellent fish as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
served there in 1850, Peter Cunningham says:—“The
white-bait is a small fish caught in the
River Thames, and long considered, but erroneously,
peculiar to this river; in no other place,
however, is it obtained in such perfection. The
fish should be cooked within an hour after being
caught, or they are apt to cling together. They
are cooked in water in a pan, from which they
are removed, as required by a skimmer. They
are then thrown on a stratum of flour, contained
in a large napkin, until completely enveloped in
flour. In this state, they are placed in a cullender
and all the superfluous flour removed by sifting.
They are next thrown into hot melted lard, contained
in a copper cauldron, or stew vessel, and placed
over a charcoal fire. A kind of ebullition immediately
commences, and in about ten minutes,
they are removed by a fine skimmer, thrown into
a cullender to drain, and then served up quite
hot. At table they are flavoured with cayenne
and lemon juice, and eaten with brown bread and
butter; iced punch being the favourite accompanying
beverage.” A dish fit to place even
before a <i lang="fr">première danseuse</i>!</p>

<p>In the company of the wealthy he gambled as
though he were one of themselves. Whence he
obtained the money to pay his losses must remain
a mystery. At the Cocoa Tree he won
£35,000 in two nights off an unfortunate Mr
Welsh.</p>

<p>Of the many “hells” of those days, Crockford’s
was the most famous and the most sumptuous;
there D’Orsay played for enormous stakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Bernal Osborne speaking through the mouth of
Hyde Park Achilles, utters this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Crockford’s “Palace of Fortune”—of misfortune
to many—was in St James’ Street, upon
a site and in a building now partly occupied by
the Devonshire Club. The house was designed
by and built in 1827 under the direction of Sir
Jeffrey Wayatville, or Wyatt, the transformer of
Windsor Castle, and its proprietor was John
Crockford, who it is reputed died worth some
£700,000; one authority indeed states that he
made over £1,000,000 in a few years out of
his famous club. The place was “palatial”; a
splendid vestibule and staircase; a state drawing-room,
a state dining-room; and—the play-room.
The number of members was between 1000 and
1200, the annual subscription being £25; the
number of candidates were out of all proportion
to the vacancies. Supper was the great institution,
but as a matter of honour it was “no play,
no supper”; no payment was asked for, so
members who did not desire to play in earnest
would, after supper, throw a £10-note upon the
play-table and leave it there. The cooking was
of the finest, Ude being the <i lang="fr">chef</i>; the cellar
admirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Ude, the following pleasing little tale is
told:—</p>

<p>Colonel Damer going into the club one evening
met his highness the <i lang="fr">chef</i> tearing up and
down in a terrible passion.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Damer.</p>

<p>“The matter, Monsieur le Colonel! Did you
see that man who has just gone out? Well, he
ordered a red mullet for his dinner. I made him
a delicious little sauce with my own hands. The
price of the mullet marked on the <i lang="fr">carte</i> was two
shillings; I added sixpence for the sauce. He
refuses to pay the sixpence. The <i lang="fr">imbécile</i> apparently
believes that the red mullets come out of
the sea, with my sauce in their pockets!”</p>

<p>Major Chambre in his amusing <cite>Recollections
of West-End Life</cite>, tells us that these free suppers
“were on so grand a scale, and so excellent, that
the Club became the refuge of all the undinnered
members and <i lang="fr">gourmets</i>, who flocked in after midnight
from White’s, Brookes’, and the Opera, to
partake of the good cheer, and try their fortunes
at the hazard-table afterwards. The wines were
of first-rate quality, and champagne and hock of
the best growths peeped out of ice-pails, to cool
the agitated nerves of those who had lost their
money. Some who had begun cautiously, and
risked but little, by degrees acquired a taste for
the excitement of play, and ended by staking
large sums.”</p>

<p>During the Parliamentary Session, supper was
served from twelve to five, and the fare was such
as to satisfy the most refined <i lang="fr">gourmet</i>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
most experienced “kernoozer.” Crockford started
the business of life by keeping a fish-stall hard
by Temple Bar.</p>

<p>“In the play-room might be heard the clear
ringing voice of that agreeable reprobate, Tom
Duncombe, as he cheerfully called ‘Seven,’ and
the powerful hand of the vigorous Sefton in
throwing for a ten. There might be noted the
scientific dribbling of a four by ‘King’ Allen,
the tremendous backing of nines and fives by Ball
Hughes and Auriol, the enormous stakes played
for by Lords Lichfield and Chesterfield, George
Payne, Sir St Vincent Cotton, D’Orsay, and
George Anson, and, above all, the gentlemanly
bearing and calm and unmoved demeanour,
under losses or gains, of all the men of that
generation.”</p>

<p><cite>The English Spy</cite> speaks quite disrespectfully
of Crocky’s: “We can sup in Crockford’s
<em>pandemonium</em> among parliamentary pigeons, unfledged
ensigns of the Guards, broken-down titled
legs, and <i lang="fr">ci-devant</i> bankers, fishmongers and
lightermen.…” Apparently unkindly wags
spoke of the Club as “Fishmongers’ Hall.”</p>

<p>“Seven’s the main! Eleven’s a nick!”</p>

<p>It was the hazard of the die! Dice at
£1, 1s. 0d. a pair cost the Club exchequer some
£2000 per annum.</p>

<p>The play-room was richly decorated and
furnished, and the centre of attraction was an
oval table covered with green baize. This board
of green cloth was marked out in white lines, and
at the corners, if there can be such to an oval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
were inscribed the mystic words “In” and “Out.”
In the centre was a space divided into squares in
each of which was inscribed a number. At the
middle of one side of the board stood two
croupiers with a box before them containing the
“bank” and with rakes in hand ready to gather
in or to pay out as luck would have it. Crockford
himself would be hovering around; here is a
sketch of him:—</p>

<p>“A little in arrear of the players a tall and
rather spare man stood, with a pale and strongly-marked
face, light grey eyes, and frosted hair.
His dress was common in the extreme, and his
appearance generally might be denominated of
that order. The only peculiarity, if, peculiarity it
can be called, was a white cravat folded so thickly
round his neck that there seemed to be quite a
superfluity of cambric in that quarter. A smile—it
might be of triumph, it might be of good-nature,
of satisfaction, of benevolence, of good-will—no,
it could not be either of these, save the
former, and yet a smile was there … there he
stood, turning a pleasant—it almost amounted to
a benevolent look—upon the progress of the
hazard, and at each countenance of the players.”</p>

<p>From the same vivacious work, a curious
account of life about town by John Mills, we now
extract an account of an imaginary gamble by
D’Orsay, called herein the Marquis d’Horsay, and
his friend Lord Chesterlane, otherwise the Earl of
Chesterfield:—</p>

<p>“Among the group, sitting and standing
about the table, were the Marquis d’Horsay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Lord Chesterlane. The former bore a disconsolate
mood; while the latter evinced thorough
satisfaction and confidence in his thoughts, or
want of them, for good-humour shone in his face,
and he now and then snapped his fingers in very
good imitation of castanets, accompanied by a
whistle both merry and loud. Large piles of red
and white counters were before him, showing that
Fortune had favoured his designs upon her
benefits.</p>

<p>“‘You’re in luck to-night, Tom,’ observed
the Marquis.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ replied his lordship, ‘I have the pull.
But what are you doing?’</p>

<p>“‘Doing!’ repeated the Marquis, ‘I’m done;
sown up; drawn as fine as spun glass; eased of
all anxiety from having my pockets picked on my
way home; and entertain, as you may see, a
lively satisfaction in the pleasant carelessness of
my situation.’</p>

<p>“‘By the nectar, honied look of the sweetest
girl that ever pointed her glass to the omnibus
box!’ swore his lordship, ‘your looks and tone
carry poor conviction to the sincerity of the
axiom. Help yourself,’ continued he, pushing a
heap of counters towards his friend, ‘and stick it
on thick.…’</p>

<p>“In a heap—yes, in one uncounted, promiscuous
heap—the Marquis gathered the ivory
checks on to the division in which the monosyllable
‘In’ was legible, and in a standing posture called
‘Five.’</p>

<p>“‘Five’s the main,’ cried one of the croupiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
looking with as much indifference at the dice as
they were sent spinning across the table from the
hand of the caster as if they had been a couple
of marbles shot from the bent knuckle of a
schoolboy.</p>

<p>“‘A nick, by Love’s sugar-candy kiss!’ said
the Earl.</p>

<p>“In a trice the counters were examined by
one of the attendants, and an addition made to
their numbers in the sum gained.</p>

<p>“With a flushed cheek and flashing eye the
Marquis scraped the whole again upon the ‘In.’”</p>

<p>Again the Marquis—that is to say D’Orsay—wins;
he wins again, and again! Again—again—again;
never withdrawing his original
stake or his winnings, but letting them lie there,
growing and growing. Then—the bank was
broken!</p>

<p>“‘By my coach and ’osses!’ exclaimed Sir
Vincent Twist, a tall, well-made, strongly-marked,
premature wrinkled, toothless—or, in the phraseology
of the ring, all the front rails gone—badly-dressed
individual.… ‘By my coach and
’osses! Fishey’s bank must be replenished!’”</p>

<p>This frankly unveracious history from which
we have quoted is doubtless as near to truthfulness
as many a ponderous volume based upon
documentary evidence of undoubted authenticity—but
that is not saying much.</p>

<p>At Crockford’s Lord Lamington, who wrote
so understandingly of the dandies, will have met
D’Orsay, with whom he was upon excellent terms:
“Men did not slouch through life”; he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
“and it was remarkable how highly they were
appreciated by the crowd, not only of the upper
but of the lower classes. I have frequently ridden
down to Richmond with Count d’Orsay. A striking
figure he was in his blue coat with gilt buttons,
thrown well back to show the wide expanse of
snowy shirt-front and buff waistcoat; his tight
leathers and polished boots; his well-curled
whiskers and handsome countenance; a wide-brimmed,
glossy hat, spotless white gloves.”</p>

<p>Doubtless it was to the famous old Star and
Garter that they rode down, the scene of many
a high jink and of much merriment by night. A
famous house with a history dating back to the
dim age of the year 1738. A very unpretentious
place at first, it was rebuilt upon a fairly fine
scale in 1780, but did not prosper. It was a
certain Christopher Crean, ex-<i lang="fr">chef</i> to his Royal
Highness the Duke of York, and after him his
widow, who brought good luck to the house. In
D’Orsay’s days it was owned by a Mr Joseph
Ellis. The old building vanished in flames in
1870.</p>

<p>It must have been a delightful place at which
to dine and spend the evening in those far-away
D’Orsay days, and very pleasant the ride or drive
down there through the country now covered with
suburbia. Dukes and dandies, pretty women of
some repute and of no repute, bright young
bucks and hoary-headed old stagers, hawks and
pigeons, the <i lang="fr">crême de la Bohême</i>, all the world
and other people’s wives, would be there;
immense the popping of corks from bottles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
champagne and claret and burgundy—the
monarch of wines. Uproarious the joviality!
They were gay dogs in those gay days!</p>

<p>Though, speaking of a somewhat later date,
Serjeant Ballantine’s account of the place may
be quoted:—</p>

<p>“Many also were the pleasant parties at the
Star and Garter at Richmond, not then the great
ugly staring barrack of a place that occupies
the site where Mr Ellis, the picture of a host,
used to receive the guests. The old house was
burnt down. In itself it had not much pretension,
but the garden behind was a perfect picture of
loveliness; the small garden-rooms, with honeysuckles,
jasmine and roses twining themselves up
the sides, with a lovely sweep of lawn, on which
were scattered trees that had flourished there for
many a long day, affording shade as well as
beauty; one magnificent spreading beech, itself a
sight, and an avenue of limes forming the prettiest
of walks at the bottom of the garden.”</p>

<p>The view was of better quality than the viands.</p>

<p>There was not a fashionable haunt of virtue
or of vice in which D’Orsay was not quite at
home. There was not any fashionable folly or
accomplishment in which he was unskilled; a
complete man-about-town, gambler, rake and
dandy. We need not pursue him in all his
pastimes; dead and gone revelries cannot be
resurrected with any satisfaction; they smell
musty. Let them lie.</p>

<span class="smaller">GORE HOUSE</span></h2>

<p>Early in 1836 Lady Blessington moved from
Mayfair out to Kensington, or—as it then practically
was—from the centre of the town to a
suburb, from Seamore Place to Gore House,
which in Grantley Berkeley’s blunt phrase became
“the headquarters of the <i lang="fr">demi-monde</i>, with the
Countess of Blessington as their queen.” She
wrote to Landor, describing her change of home,
that she had “taken up her residence in the
country, being a mile from London.”</p>

<p>The house stood close down to the roadway,
occupying part of the site upon which now stands
the Albert Hall—why <em>not</em> named after Alfred,
Count d’Orsay? It was secluded from the traffic
by a high wall and a sparse row of trees, two
large double gates surmounted by old-fashioned
lanterns giving access to the short drive. The
building was low and quite common-place,
painted white, its only external claim to charm
being the beautiful gardens at the back. William
Wilberforce, a previous tenant, writes:—</p>

<p>“We are just one mile from the turnpike at
Hyde Park Corner, having about three acres of
pleasure-ground around our house, or rather
behind it, and several old trees, walnut and
mulberry, of thick foliage. I can sit and read
under their shade with as much admiration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
beauties of Nature as if I were down in Yorkshire,
or anywhere else 200 miles from the great city.”</p>

<p>Under those shady trees far other folk now
sat, and we doubt not their meditations were of
the town rather than of the beauties of Nature.
Of such an assemblage D’Orsay painted a picture,
which to a certain extent gives the keynote to
the history of Gore House for the next fourteen
years. It is a view of the garden side of the
house and among those portrayed in the groups
that occupy the foreground are in addition to
D’Orsay and Lady Blessington, the Duke of Wellington
and his son, Lord Douro, of which latter
Greville says: “Une lune bien pâle auprès de son
père, but far from a dull man, and not deficient in
information”; Sir Edwin Landseer, sketching a
cow, Lord Chesterfield, Lord Brougham, and Lady
Blessington’s fair nieces, the two Misses Power.</p>

<p>Of course D’Orsay also moved out to
Kensington, at first living next door to Gore
House at No. 4 Kensington Gore.</p>

<p>Bulwer writing to Lord Durham on many
matters, notes the move from Seamore Place:—</p>

<p>“Lady Blessington has moved into Wilberforce’s
old house at Knightsbridge.… She has
got Gore House for ten years. It cost her
a thousand pounds in repairs, about another
thousand in new furniture, entails two gardeners,
two cows, and another housemaid; but she
declares with the gravest of all possible faces
she only does it for—economy! D’Orsay is
installed in a cottage <i lang="fr">orné</i> next door, and has
set up an aviary of the best-dressed birds in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Ornithology. He could not turn naturalist in
anything else but Dandies. The very pigeons
have trousers down to their claws and have the
habit of looking over their left shoulder,” of
course to see that no evil-minded man-of-law
was approaching with a writ.</p>

<p>Afterward, doubtless realising that any further
pretence at propriety was mere waste of energy
and money, he lived in Gore House itself, in the
grounds of which he erected his studio. Charles
Greville, who so often dipped his pen in gall,
speaking of D’Orsay’s art work, declares that he
“constantly got helped, and his works retouched
by eminent artists, whose society he cultivated,
and many of whom were his intimate friends.”
Yet we find Benjamin Robert Haydon recording
on 10th July 1839, while he was painting his
portrait of Wellington:—</p>

<p>“D’Orsay called, and pointed out several
things to correct in the horse.… I did them,
and he took my brush in his dandy gloves, which
made my heart ache, and lowered his hindquarters
by bringing over a bit of the sky. Such
a dress! white great-coat, blue satin cravat, hair
oiled and curling, hat of the primest curve and
purest water, gloves scented with <i lang="fr">eau de Cologne</i>,
or <i lang="fr">eau de jasmin</i>, primrose in tint, skin in tightness.
In this prime of dandyism he took up
a nasty, oily, dirty hog-tool, and immortalised
Copenhagen by touching the sky. I thought,
after he was gone, this won’t do—a Frenchman
touch Copenhagen! So out I rubbed all he had
touched, and modified his hints myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>So strange that Haydon should not have
recognised that the touch of the dandy’s handiwork
would immortalise the picture! There are
many historical painters, but only a few great
dandies. So little do great men appreciate
greater men! D’Orsay was from now onward
to the day of his fall at the top of his fame.</p>

<p>At Gore House the <i lang="fr">salon</i> presided over by
D’Orsay and Lady Blessington was even more
brilliant than that at Seamore Place, though time
was beginning to play his unkindly tricks at the
lady’s expense, and debt was dogging the footsteps
of the gentleman.</p>

<p>Of the former William Archer Shee gives a
description too glowing to be true:—</p>

<p>“Gore House last night was unusually
brilliant. Lady Blessington has the art of
collecting around her all that is best worth
knowing in the <em>male</em> society of London. There
were Cabinet Ministers, diplomats, poets, painters,
and politicians, all assembled together.… She
has the peculiar and most unusual talent of
keeping the conversation in a numerous circle
<em>general</em>, and of preventing her guests from
dividing into little selfish <i lang="fr">pelotons</i>. With a tact
unsurpassed, she contrives to draw out even the
most modest tyro from his shell of reserve, and,
by appearing to take an interest in his opinion,
gives him the courage to express it. All her
visitors seem, by some hidden influence, to find
their level, yet they leave her house satisfied
with themselves.”</p>

</div>

<p>But Madden, who was more intimate with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
than perhaps anyone else save D’Orsay, gives us
a peep behind the mask of gaiety. He declares
that there was no real happiness in those Gore
House days; the skeletons in their cupboards
were rattling their bones. Lady Blessington’s
merriment had no longer the sparkle of genuine
vivacity, was no longer unforced. Cares and
troubles grew upon her; her “conversation
generally was no longer of that gay, enlivening,
cheerful character, abounding in drollery and
humour, which made the great charm of her
<i lang="fr">réunions</i> in the Villa Belvedere, and in a minor
degree in Seamore Place.”</p>

<p>This is supported by Bulwer in a letter to
Albany Fonblanque in September 1837: “I had
a melancholyish letter from Lady Blessington
the other day. It always seems to me as if
D’Orsay’s <i lang="fr">blague</i> was too much for her. People
who live with those too high-spirited for them
always appear to me to get the life sucked
out of them. The sun drinks up the dews.”
So does the passage of years. Lady Blessington
was now fading. The background
of her life had grown grey; the passage
of years was impairing her beauty; money
matters troubled her sorely, and it cannot have
added to the joy of life to know that her love
and her charms no longer satisfied all the
requirements of her lover. Banishment from
the society of almost every respectable woman
must also have grated upon her who was born
to reign over society.</p>

<p>As for D’Orsay, his existence was one perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
gallop after pleasure and to escape the
clutches of duns and their myrmidons. As far
back as his arrival in England he had been
arrested on account of a debt of a mere £300 to
his Paris bootmaker, M’Henry, who, however,
did not enforce imprisonment, but allowed the bill
to run on for several years. The mere fact of
D’Orsay being his patron brought him the custom
of all the exquisites of Paris.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent misery for “the gorgeous”
Lady Blessington; but D’Orsay possessed a heart
and spirit above trifles; the conqueror of to-day
does not discount his present pleasure by any foreboding
of defeat to-morrow. D’Orsay had conquered
London society, almost all the male members
of it and not a few of its female; with his wit
and his good looks he could gain for love what
only money could obtain for less favoured rivals.</p>

<p>Of the fair, frail ones who were to be met
with at Gore House one of the most distinguished,
if not for good looks, at any rate for the good
fortune of having had a famous lover, was the
Countess Guiccioli. Shee met her there in the
spring of 1837, and was sorely disappointed.
He considered her a “fubsy woman,” without
youth, beauty or grace; short, thick-set, lacking
in style: “She sang several Italian airs to her
own accompaniment, in a very pretentious manner,
and her voice is loud and somewhat harsh.” It
is told of her that once at a great house, when
all were alert to hear the song to which she was
playing the introduction, she suddenly clasped
her—waist, exclaiming—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good Lord! I’ve over-eaten myself!”</p>

<p>Lady Blessington gives a kindlier portrait:
“Her face is decidedly handsome, the features
regular and well proportioned, her complexion
delicately fair, her teeth very fine, and her hair of
that rich golden tint, which is peculiar to the female
pictures by Titian and Giorgione. Her countenance
is very pleasing; its general character is pensive,
but it can be lit up with animation and gaiety,
when its expression is very agreeable. Her bust
and arms are exquisitely beautiful.…”</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt tells us that she possessed the
handsomest nose he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Opinions differ about beauties as about other
matters, so it will not hurt to hear what Henry
Reeve has to say:—</p>

<p>“October 15th (1839).—I have been a good
deal at Gore House lately, attracted and amused
by Mme. de Guiccioli, who is staying with my
lady. Having recently made the acquaintance
of Lady Byron, it is very curious to me to
compare the manners and character of her
celebrated rival. The Guiccioli is still exceedingly
beautiful. She has sunbeams of hair, a
fine person, and a milky complexion. Her spirits
are wonderful, and her conversation brilliant even
in the most witty house in London. Besides
which, she alone of all Italian women knows
some things. Besides a fine taste, which belongs
to them by nature, she has a good share of literary
attainments, which, as her beauty fails, will smooth
a track from coquetry to pedantry, from the
courted beauty to the courted blue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>She and D’Orsay were very good friends;
there are constant messages to her from him in
Lady Blessington’s letters:—“Count d’Orsay
charges me with the kindest regards for you;
we often think and talk of the pleasant hours
passed in your society at Anglesey, when your
charming voice and agreeable conversation, gave
wings to them.” And: “Comte d’Orsay charges
me with <i lang="fr">mille choses aimables</i> to you; you have,
<i lang="fr">malgré all discussions</i>, secured a very warm and
sincere friend in him.” And, writing from Gore
House on 15th August 1839: “Your friend
Alfred charges me with his kindest regards to
you. He is now an inmate at Gore House,
having sold his own residence; and this is not
only a great protection but a great addition to
my comfort.” A quite pleasantly frank confession
to the mistress of a great poet from the
mistress of a great dandy. But there have been
greater poets than Byron, not any greater dandy
than D’Orsay, so the Blessington was the prouder
woman of the two.</p>

</div>

<p>The following, written in January 1845, must
be quoted in full, and read with the remembrance
to the fore that Lady Blessington posed in conversation
and in print as having been on terms
of intimate friendship with Byron. “… You
have, I daresay, heard that your friend Count
d’Orsay has within the last two years taken
to painting, and such has been the rapidity of his
progress, that he has left many competitors, who
have been for fifteen years painters, far behind.</p>

<p>“Dissatisfied with all the portraits that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
been painted of Lord Byron, none of which
render justice to the intellectual beauty of his
noble head, Count d’Orsay, at my request, has
made a portrait of our great poet, and it has been
pronounced by Sir John Cam Hobhouse, and
all who remember Lord Byron, to be the best
likeness of him ever painted! The picture
possesses all the noble intelligence and fine
character of the poet’s face, and will, I am sure,
delight you when you see it. We have had it
engraved, and when the plate is finished, a print
will be sent to you. It will be interesting, <i lang="fr">chère
et aimable amie</i>, to have a portrait of our great
poet, from a painting by one who so truly esteems
you: for you have not a truer friend than Count
d’Orsay, unless it be me. How I wish you were
here to see the picture! It is an age since we
met, and I assure you we all feel this long separation
as a great privation. I shall be greatly
disappointed if you are not as delighted with the
engraving as I am, for to me it seems the very
image of Byron.”</p>

<p>“Our great poet” would have torn the hair
of his noble head if he had read this quaint production.
La Guiccioli did approve the engraving
to the contentment of the artist.</p>

<p>Shee tells us that the Countess on her visits
to Gore House was overwhelmed by her more
showy hostess, and by her sister, the Countess
Saint Marceau, the latter forming a fine foil to
the more exuberant Lady Blessington, being
slight, short, small-featured, but extremely pretty
and piquant, and, as Madden tells us, “always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
courted and complimented in society, and
coquetted with by gentlemen of a certain age, by
humourists in single blessedness, especially like
Gell, and by old married bachelors like Landor.”</p>

<p>Landor visited Lady Blessington in 1837;
he writes to Forster: “I shall be at Gore House
on Monday, pray come in the evening. I told
Lady Blessington I should not let any of her
court stand at all in my way. When I am tired
of them, I leave them.”</p>

<p>It is very strong proof of the fascination
exercised by D’Orsay that such men as Landor,
Carlyle and Forster, each one of whom we would
think impervious to his charms, should have
succumbed to them.</p>

<p>Landor’s enslavement by Lady Blessington
or her sister is understandable, but what
attracted him in D’Orsay? Chorley gives us a
glimpse of Landor dining at Gore House when
its master was absent: “Yesterday evening, I
had a very rare treat—a dinner at Kensington
<i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Lady Blessington and Mr
Landor; she talked her best, brilliant and kindly,
and without that touch of self-consciousness
which she sometimes displays when worked up to
it by flatterers and gay companions. Landor,
as usual, the very finest man’s head I have ever
seen, and with all his Johnsonian disposition to
tyrannise and lay down the law in his talk,
restrained and refined by an old-world courtesy
and deference to his bright hostess, for which
<em>chivalry</em> is the only right word.”</p>

<p>Landor conceived quite an affection for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
D’Orsay; perhaps at heart they <em>both</em> were dandies?
Here is a pleasant bit of chaff from Landor,
written to Lady Blessington: “By living at
Clifton, I am grown as rich as Rothschild; and
if Count d’Orsay could see me in my new coat,
he would not write me so pressingly to come up
to London. It would breed ill-blood between us—half
plague, half cholera. He would say—‘I wish
the fellow had his red forehead again—the deuce
might powder it for me.’ However, as I go out
very little, I shall not divide the world with him.”</p>

<p>Once when Landor was dining at Gore House,
his attire had become slightly disordered, to which
fact D’Orsay smilingly drew attention as they rose
to join the ladies. “My dear Count d’Orsay,” exclaimed
Landor, “I thank you! My dear Count
d’Orsay I thank you from my soul for pointing out
to me the abominable condition to which I am
reduced! If I had entered the drawing-room, and
presented myself before Lady Blessington in so
absurd a light, I would have instantly gone home,
put a pistol to my head, and blown my brains out!”</p>

<p>In January 1840, Henry Reeve was at dinner
at Gore House, and gives a capital account of the
fun there:—</p>

<p>“Our dinner last night was very good fun,
but we made rather too many puns. Landor
rode several fine paradoxes with savage impetuosity:
particularly his theory that the Chinese
are the only civilised people in the world. I am
sure the Ching dynasty has not a firmer adherent
than Landor within its own imperial capital.
Landor, you know, is quite as vain of not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
read, as Bulwer is of being the most popular
writer of the day. Nothing can equal the
contempt with which he treats anybody who has
more than six readers and three admirers unless
it be that saying of Hegel’s, when he declared
that nobody understood his writings but himself,
and that not always. Lady B(lessington) said
the finest thing of Carlyle’s productions that ever
was uttered; she called them ‘spangled fustian.’”</p>

<p>Forster and D’Orsay got on very well together,
which was perhaps due to the almost if not quite
exaggerated respect paid by the former to the
latter. He was heard above the roar of talk at
one of his dinners, absolutely shouting to his man
Henry: “Good heavens, sir, butter for the
Count’s flounders!” D’Orsay contrived to
misunderstand him very nicely on an occasion.
Forster when expecting a visit from the Count
was urgently summoned to his printers. He
gave his servant strict injunction to tell the
Count, should he call before his return, that he
had just gone round to Messrs Spottiswoode.
He missed his visitor entirely, and his explanation
when next he met him was cut short by—“Ah! I
know, you had just gone round to <em>Ze Spotted
Dog</em>—I understand.”</p>

<p>In 1835 Lady Blessington writes to Forster
from Gore House:</p>

<p>“It has given me the greatest pleasure to
hear that you are so much better. Count
d’Orsay assures me that the improvement is
most satisfactory. Tomorrow will be the
anniversary of his birthday, and a few friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
will meet to celebrate it. How I wish you were
to be among the number.” Ten years later,
when Forster again was on the sick-list, she
writes: “If you knew the anxiety we all feel about
your health, and the fervent prayers we offer up
for its speedy restoration, you would be convinced,
that though you have friends of longer
date, you have none more affectionately and
sincerely attached to you than those at Gore
House. I claim the privilege of an <em>old woman</em> to
be allowed to see you as soon as a visitor in a
sick-room can be admitted. Sterne says that ‘A
friend has the same right as a physician,’ and I
hope you will remember this. Count d’Orsay
every day regrets that he cannot go and nurse
you, and we both often wish you were here, that
we might try our power of alleviating your illness,
if not of curing you. God bless you, and restore
you speedily to health.”</p>

<p>Macready turns up, if we may use words so
flippant of a man so serious, at Gore House in
1837. “Reached Lady Blessington’s about a
quarter before eight,” he writes. “Found there
Fonblanque, Bulwer, Trelawney, Procter, Auldjo,
Forster, Lord Canterbury, Fred Reynolds and
Mr and Mrs Fairlie, Kenney, a young Manners
Sutton, Count d’Orsay and some unknown. I passed
an agreeable day, and had a long and interesting
conversation in the drawing-room (what an elegant
and splendid room it is!) with D’Orsay on pictures.”</p>

<p>Of the members of the party that Macready
found himself amongst—Lord Canterbury, when
he was the Right Honourable Charles Manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Sutton and Speaker of the House of Commons,
had married in 1828 Lady Blessington’s sister
Ellen, of whom Moore speaks as “Mrs Speaker”:
“Amused to see her, in all her state, the same
hearty, lively Irishwoman still.” She had first
been married to a Mr Purves. Mrs Fairlie was
Mrs Purves’ eldest daughter, Louisa, who while
quite young had married Mr John Fairlie.
Trelawney was the “Younger Son,” whose
“Adventures” are so entertaining and exciting,
the intimate of Shelley and Byron, and the model
for the old sea captain of Millais’ “North-West
Passage.” Procter was “Barry Cornwall”; John
Auldjo had been introduced to Lady Blessington
by Gell in 1834; Frederick Mansell Reynolds
was a minor poet and writer of tales, a letter from
whom shows D’Orsay in a pleasant light. It is
written from Jersey in 1837—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lady Blessington</span>,—After having
so recently seen you, and being so powerfully
and so painfully under the influence of a desire
never again to place the sea between me and
yourself and circle, I feel almost provoked to find
how much this place suits me in every physical
respect.… You and Count d’Orsay speak
kindly and cheerfully to me; but I am <i lang="fr">un malade
imaginaire</i>, for I do not fear death; on the
contrary, I rather look to it as my only hope of
secure and lasting tranquillity. In the lull which
has hitherto accompanied my return to this
delicious climate, I have had time and opportunity
for ample retrospection, and I find that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have both<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> laid in a stock of regard for Count
d’Orsay which is immeasurable: anybody so
good-natured and so kind-hearted I never before
saw; it seems to me that it should be considered
an inestimable privilege to live in his society.
When you write to me, pray be good enough to
acquaint me whether you have been told verbatim
what a lady said on the subject; for praise so
natural, hearty and agreeable was never before
uttered in a soliloquy, which her speech really
was, though I was present at the time.</p>

<p>“At the risk of repeating, I really must tell it
to you. After Count d’Orsay’s departure from our
house, there was a pause, when it was broken, by her
exclaiming, ‘What a very nice man!’ I assented
in my own mind, but I was pursuing also a chain
of thought of my own, and I made no audible
reply. Our ruminations then proceeded, when
mine were once more interrupted by her saying:
‘In fact, he is the <em>nicest man I ever saw</em>.’</p>

<p>“This is a pleasant avowal to me, I thought;
but still I could not refrain from admitting that
she was right. Then again, for a third time, the
mental machinery of both went to work in silence,
until that of the lady reached a <i lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of
admiration, and she ejaculated in an ecstasy: ‘Indeed,
he is the nicest man that can possibly be!’”</p>

</div>

<p>The Kenney mentioned by Macready must
have been James, who as the author of <cite>Raising
the Wind</cite>, and of <cite>Sweethearts and Wives</cite>, was a
singularly appropriate friend for the impecunious,
amorous D’Orsay.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington reported that in June 1838,
London was “insupportable. The streets and
the Park crowded to suffocation, and all the
people gone mad”; but in the same month Dizzy
writes in a different key: “We had a very
agreeable party at D’Orsay’s yesterday. Zichy,
who has cut out even Esterhazy, having two
jackets; one of diamonds more brilliant than
E.’s, and another which he wore at the drawing-room
yesterday of turquoises. This makes the
greatest sensation of the two.… Then there
was the Duke of Ossuna, a young man, but a
grandee of the highest grade.… He is a
great dandy and looks like Philip II., but though
the only living descendant of the Borgias, he has
the reputation of being very amiable. When he
was last at Paris he attended a representation of
Victor Hugo’s <cite>Lucrezia Borgia</cite>. She says in
one of the scenes: ‘Great crimes are in our
blood.’ All his friends looked at him with an
expression of fear; ‘But the blood has degenerated,’
he said, ‘for I have committed only
weaknesses.’ Then there was the real Prince
Poniatowsky, also young and with a most brilliant
star. Then came Kissiloffs and Strogonoffs,
‘and other offs and ons,’ and de Belancour, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
very agreeable person. Lyndhurst, Gardner,
Bulwer and myself completed the party.”</p>

<p>D’Ossuna died while quite a young man and
was succeeded by his brother, also a friend of
D’Orsay.</p>

<p>This must have been a curiously polyglot
gathering, and the noble company of dandies was
brilliantly represented by D’Orsay, Bulwer and
Dizzy, not to mention Zichy of the turquoise
jacket.</p>

<p>There is both amusement and interest in the
record of the year 1839, during which all pretence
at a separate establishment was cast aside, and
the D’Orsay-Blessington alliance was publicly
acknowledged by the gentleman taking up his
residence in the lady’s house.</p>

<p>D’Orsay went down this year to Bradenham,
on a visit to the Disraelis.</p>

<p>It is not uninteresting to know that Bradenham
and Hurstley in <cite>Endymion</cite> are one and the
same place, and thus described:—</p>

<p>“At the foot of the Berkshire downs, and itself
on a gentle elevation, there is an old hall with
gable ends and lattice windows, standing in
grounds which once were stately, and where there
are yet glade-like terraces of yew-trees, which
give an air of dignity to a neglected scene. In
the front of the hall huge gates of iron, highly
wrought, and bearing an ancient date as well as
the shield of a noble house, opened on a village
green, round which were clustered the cottages of
the parish, with only one exception, and that was
the vicarage house, a modern building, not without
taste, and surrounded by a small but brilliant
garden. The church was contiguous to the hall,
and had been raised by the lord on a portion of
his domain. Behind the hall and its enclosure
the country was common land but picturesque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
It had once been a beech forest, and though the
timber had been greatly cleared, the green land
was occasionally dotted, sometimes with groups
and sometimes with single trees, while the juniper
which here abounded, and rose to a great height,
gave a rich wildness to the scene, and sustained
its forest character.” It is easy to fit the author
of the <cite>Curiosities of Literature</cite> into this framework,
but in this old-world hall two such gorgeous
butterflies as D’Orsay and the writer of <cite>Vivian
Grey</cite> seem rather astray. It would be almost as
startling to find a dog-rose climbing up a lamp-post
in Pall Mall, or honeysuckle adorning the
front of the Thatched House.</p>

<p>Disraeli writes to Lady Blessington:—</p>

<p>“We send you back our dearest D’Orsay, with
some of the booty of yesterday’s sport as our
homage to you. His visit has been very short,
but very charming, and everybody here loves
him as much as you and I do. I hope that I shall
soon see you, and see you well; and in the meantime,
I am, as I shall ever be, your affectionate—”</p>

<p>Concerning an earlier occasion, Disraeli writes
from Bradenham on 5th August 1834, to Lady
Blessington:—</p>

<p>“I suppose it is vain to hope to see my dear
D’Orsay here; I wish indeed he would come.
Here is a wish by no means contemptible. He
can bring his horses if he likes, but I can mount
him. Adieu, dear Lady Blessington, some day I
will try to write you a more amusing letter; at
present I am in truth ill and sad.”</p>

<p>Charles Greville was at Gore House on 17th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
February, and seems to have enjoyed himself
pretty well:—</p>

<p>“February 17th.—I dined at Lady Blessington’s
yesterday, to meet Durham and Brougham;
but, after all, the latter did not come, and the
excuse he made was, that it was better not; and
as he was taking, or going to take (we shall see)
a moderate course about Canada, it would impair
his efficacy if the press were to trumpet forth, and
comment on, his meeting with Durham. There
was that sort of strange omnium gatherum party
which is to be met with nowhere else, and which
for that reason alone is curious. We had Prince
Louis Napoleon and his A.D.C.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He is a short,
thickish, vulgar-looking man, without the slightest
resemblance to his imperial uncle, or any intelligence
in his countenance. Then we had the ex-Governor
of Canada, Captain Marriott, the Count
Alfred de Vigny (author of <cite lang="fr">Cinq Mars</cite>, etc.),
Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer, and a proper
sprinkling of ordinary persons to mix up with
these celebrities. In the evening, Forster, sub-editor
of the <cite>Examiner</cite>; Chorley, editor of the
<cite>Athenæum</cite>; Macready and Charles Buller. Lady
Blessington’s existence is a curiosity, and her
house and society have at least the merit of being
singular, though the latter is not so agreeable as
from its composition it ought to be. There is no
end to the men of consequence and distinction in
the world who go there occasionally—Brougham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Lyndhurst, Abinger, Canterbury, Durham, and
many others; all the minor poets, <i lang="la">literati</i>, and
journalists, without exception, together with some
of the highest pretensions. Moore is a sort of
friend of hers; she had been very intimate with
Byron, and is with Walter Savage Landor. Her
house is furnished with a luxury and splendour
not to be surpassed; her dinners are frequent and
good; and D’Orsay does the honours with a
frankness and cordiality which are very successful;
but all this does not make society, in the real
meaning of the term. There is a vast deal of
coming and going, and eating and drinking, and
a corresponding amount of noise, but little or no
conversation, discussion, easy quiet interchange
of ideas and opinions, no regular social foundation
of men of intellectual or literary calibre ensuring
a perennial flow of conversation, and which, if it
existed, would derive strength and assistance from
the light superstructure of occasional visitors, with
the much or the little they might individually
contribute. The reason of this is that the woman
herself, who must give the tone to her own
society, and influence its character, is ignorant,
vulgar, and commonplace.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Nothing can be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
dull and uninteresting than her conversation,
which is never enriched by a particle of knowledge,
or enlivened by a ray of genius or imagination.
The fact of her existence as an authoress
is an enigma, poor as her pretensions are; for
while it is very difficult to write good books, it is
not easy to compose even bad ones, and volumes
have come forth under her name for which
hundreds of pounds have been paid, because
(Heaven only can tell how) thousands are found
who will read them. Her ‘Works’ have been
published in America, in one huge folio, where it
seems they meet with peculiar success; and this
trash goes down, because it is written by a
Countess, in a country where rank is eschewed,
and equality is the universal passion. They have
(or some of them) been likewise translated into
German; and if all this is not proof of literary
merit, or at least of success, what is? It would
be not uninteresting to trace this current of
success to its source, and to lay bare all the
springs of the machinery which sustains her
artificial character as an authoress. The details
of course form the mystery of her craft, but the
general causes are apparent enough. First and
foremost, her magnificent house and luxurious
dinners; then the alliance offensive and defensive
which she has contrived (principally through the
means of said house and dinners) to establish
with a host of authors, booksellers, and publishers,
and above all with journalists. The first lend
her their assistance in composition, correction, or
addition; with the second she manages to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
an interest and an interchange of services;
and the last everlastingly puff her performances.
Her name is eternally before the public; she
produces those gorgeous inanities, called <cite>Books of
Beauty</cite>, and other trashy things of the same
description, to get up which all the fashion and
beauty, the taste and talent, of London are laid
under contribution. The most distinguished
artists and the best engravers supply the portraits
of the prettiest women in London; and these are
illustrated with poetical effusions of the smallest
possible merit, but exciting interest and curiosity
from the notoriety of their authors; and so, by
all this puffing, and stuffing, and untiring industry,
and practising on the vanity of some, and the
good-nature of others, the end is attained; and
though I never met with any individual who had
read any of her books, except the <cite>Conversations
with Byron</cite>, which are too good to be hers, they
are unquestionably a source of considerable profit,
and she takes her place confidently and complacently
as one of the literary celebrities of her day.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Conversations</cite> were in all probability
almost entirely the composition of Lady Blessington,
more so indeed than they had any right to
be, Byron’s sayings being the invention to some
extent at any rate of the lively imagination of the
so-called recorder. But it is not necessary here—or
anywhere—to discuss Lady Blessington’s
performances as a writer of fiction.</p>

<p>The Durham referred to by Greville was
John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham,
who in 1838 had been appointed Governor-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the British provinces of North America,
and whose somewhat arbitrary proceedings there
had not met with universal approbation. But there
cannot be any doubt that in the main he was
right and wise. Charles Buller, his secretary,
is reputed to have been the author of Durham’s

<p>When Lord Durham was making ready for his
departure to Canada, he included among his immense
baggage a large number of musical instruments.
“What on earth are they for?” said a wonderer.
To whom Sydney Smith: “Don’t you know he
is going to make overtures to the Canadians?”</p>

<p>George Ticknor describes Durham in 1838 as
“little, dark-complexioned, red-faced-looking.”
Charles Greville had many severe things to say
of him—and said them.</p>

<p>Durham seems to have been on fairly intimate
terms with Lady Blessington. In 1835 he writes
from Cowes:—</p>

<p>“I thank you much for your very agreeable
letter, which I received this morning, and
for your kind inquiries after my health, which
is wonderfully improved, if not quite restored, by
this fine air, and <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i> life. I anticipate
with horror the time when I shall be obliged
to leave it, and mix once more in the <em>troublous</em>
realities of <em>public life</em>.”</p>

<p>Durham died in 1840, and of the event Alfred
de Vigny wrote to Lady Blessington:—</p>

trouvé un soir si profondément affecté de la

Durham. J’aimais toujours à me figurer que je le

<p>Charles Buller will perhaps be chiefly remembered
as the pupil of Carlyle and the friend
of Thackeray, who on his death in 1848 wrote to
Mrs Brookfield:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lady</span>—I am very much pained
and shocked at the news brought at dinner
to-day that poor dear Charles Buller is gone.
Good God! think about the poor mother surviving,
and what an anguish that must be!
If I were to die I cannot bear to think of my
mother living beyond me, as I daresay she will.
But isn’t it an awful, awful sudden summons?
There go wit, fame, friendship, ambition, high
repute! Ah! <i lang="fr">aimons nous bien</i>. It seems to me
that is the only thing we can carry away. When
we go let us have some who love us wherever we
are.… Good-night.”</p>

<p>Thackeray, himself “no small beer” as a
dandy in his young days, was a visitor to Gore
House, and we fancy liked its mistress better than
its master, with whom, however, he was on
quite friendly terms. Lady Ritchie remembers
a morning call paid by D’Orsay to her father:—</p>

<p>“The most splendid person I ever remember
seeing had a little pencil sketch in his hand, which
he left behind him on the table. It was a very
feeble sketch; it seemed scarcely possible to
admiring little girls that so grand a being should
not be a bolder draughtsman. He appeared to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
one Sunday morning in the sunshine. When I
came hurrying down to breakfast I found him sitting
beside my father at the table with an untasted cup of
tea before him; he seemed to fill the bow-window
with radiance as if he were Apollo; he leant against
his chair with one elbow resting on its back, with
shining studs and curls and boots. We could see
his horse looking in at us over the blind.… I
think my father had a certain weakness for dandies,
those knights of the broadcloth and shining fronts.
Magnificent apparitions used to dawn upon us in
the hall sometimes, glorious beings on their way
to the study, but this one outshone them all.”</p>

<p>By the way, Chorley was never editor of
the <cite>Athenæum</cite> as Greville states.</p>

<p>As for Brougham, what shall we say of that
curious mixture of a man? Three parts genius
and one part humbug?</p>

<p>It was at Gore House on 21st October 1839,
that Alfred Montgomery read out the letter he
had received which purported to come from Mr
Shafto at Penrith, at Brougham Hall. It announced
that Brougham had been killed by the overturning
of a postchaise in which he was driving. The company
present were completely deceived and the
news was communicated to the papers, which with
the exception of <cite>The Times</cite> gave it currency.</p>

<p>Henry Reeve was dining at the club when he
heard a rumour that Brougham was ill, and straightway
went up to Gore House, to find if there were
any news. The letter had been brought over by
Alfred Montgomery to Gore House early in the
morning; Shafto was the only uninjured survivor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the party of three in the chaise; Brougham had been
stunned by a kick from one of the horses, thrown
down and the carriage had turned over on to him,
crushing him to death. D’Orsay spread the news
round the town in the afternoon, when he took
his walk abroad. Reeve had better be left to tell
the rest of the story of that evening:—</p>

<p>“It was the most melancholy evening I ever
spent there. In no house was Brougham so
entirely tamed; in none, except his own, so
much beloved. Only last Sunday week—not
ten days ago—just six before his death—he dined
there, and stayed very late, which he rarely did,
leaving them dazzled with the brilliancy of his
unflagging spirit. I was to have dined there
too; they very earnestly pressed me; but I
had promised to go to Richmond. They tried
hard, too, to get Sir A. Paget; but we both
stayed away, and they sat down to table <em>thirteen</em>.
I can only say that the deaths which have struck
me most in my life have always been preceded by
a dinner of thirteen, in spite of efforts to avoid it.”</p>

<p>Brougham, it is said, was very much interested
in reading his obituary notices! Shafto promptly
denounced the letter as a forgery. Who then
wrote it? The Duke of Cambridge among many
others suspected the corpse, and greeted Brougham
at a Privy Council meeting with: “Damn you,
you dog, <em>you</em> wrote that letter, you know you
did!” and chased him round the room. D’Orsay
apparently held the same opinion and was in
turn himself accused of the hoax. Fonblanque
writes to Lady Blessington:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“The falsehood that Count d’Orsay had
anything to do with the hoax was sufficiently
refuted by all who knew him, by the two circumstances
that it was stupid and cruel; and the
unique characteristic of D’Orsay is, that the most
brilliant wit is uniformly exercised in the most
good-natured way. He can be wittier with kindness
than the rest of the world with malice.”</p>

<p>Reeve asserts roundly that Brougham wrote
later to Montgomery, admitting that he was the
perpetrator of the “thoughtless jest,” and continues:
“D’Orsay drew a capital sketch of
Brougham in his plaid trousers, from memory,
which we thought invaluable; and nobody could
look at his wild, uncouth handwriting without
tears in his eyes. In short, so bad a joke was
never played off on so large a scale before; but
one can’t look forward without a good deal of
amusement to Brougham’s telling the story.”</p>

<p>We meet Lyndhurst and Brougham together
at Gore House this year, just as they appeared
together in <cite>Punch</cite> later on in that famous cartoon
“The Mrs Caudle of the House of Lords,” drawn
by Leech and invented by Thackeray. The
picture represents Lyndhurst as Lord Chancellor
reposing in bed, his head upon the woolsack,
beside him Mrs Caudle Brougham, very much
awake, and saying: “What do you say?
<em>Thank heaven! You are going to enjoy the
recess—and you’ll be rid of me for some months?</em>
Never mind. Depend upon it, when you come
back, you shall have it again. No: I don’t raise
the House, and set everybody in it by the ears;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
but I’m not going to give up every little privilege;
though it’s seldom I open my lips, goodness knows!”</p>

<p>Charles Sumner, the famous American senator
and jurist, visited Gore House in March, and records:</p>

<p>“As I entered her brilliant drawing-room, she
came forward to receive me with that bewitching
manner and skilful flattery which still give her
such influence. ‘Ah, Mr Sumner,’ she said,
‘how sorry I am that you are so late! Two of
your friends have just left us—Lord Lyndhurst
and Lord Brougham; they have been pronouncing
your <i lang="fr">éloge</i>.’ She was, of course, the only
lady present; and she was surrounded by D’Orsay,
Bulwer, Disraeli, Duncombe, the Prince Napoleon,
and two or three lords. The house is a palace of
Armida, about two miles from town.… The
rooms are furnished in the most brilliant French
style, and flame with costly silks, mirrored doors,
bright lights, and golden ornaments. But Lady
Blessington is the chief ornament. The world
says she is almost fifty-eight; by her own confession
she must be over fifty, and yet she seems hardly
forty: at times I might believe her twenty-five.”</p>

<p>Of D’Orsay, Sumner writes, he “surpasses all
my expectations. He is the divinity of dandies;
in another age he would have passed into the
court of the gods, and youths would have sacrificed
to the God of Fashion.… I have seen
notes and letters from him, both in French and
English, which are some of the cleverest I have
ever read; and in conversation, whether French
or English, he is excessively brilliant.”</p>

<p>But most amazing of all his conquests was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
D’Orsay’s subduing of Carlyle. Would it not
have been thought that the dandy would have
been a type peculiarly irritating to the author of
<cite lang="la">Sartor Resartus</cite>?</p>

<p>On 16th April 1839, Carlyle writes from
Cheyne Row to his brother John:—</p>

<p>“… I must tell you of the strangest compliment
of all, which occurred since I wrote last—the
advent of Count D’Orsay. About a fortnight ago,
this Phœbus Apollo of dandyism, escorted by poor
little Chorley, came whirling hither in a chariot
that struck all Chelsea into mute amazement with
splendour. Chorley’s under jaw went like the
hopper or under riddle of a pair of fanners, such
was his terror on bringing such a splendour into
actual contact with such a grimness. Nevertheless,
we did amazingly well, the Count and I. He is
a tall fellow of six feet three, built like a tower, with
floods of dark auburn hair, with a beauty, with an
adornment unsurpassable on this planet; withal a
rather substantial fellow at bottom, by no means
without insight, without fun, and a sort of rough
sarcasm rather striking out of such a porcelain
figure. He said, looking at Shelley’s bust, in his
French accent: ‘Ah, it is one of those faces who
weesh to swallow their chin.’ He admired the fine
epic, etc., etc.; hoped I would call soon, and see
Lady Blessington withal. Finally he went his way,
and Chorley with re-assumed jaw. Jane laughed
for two days at the contrast of my plaid dressing-gown,
bilious, iron countenance, and this Paphian
apparition. I did not call till the other day, and
left my card merely. I do not see well what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
good I can get by meeting him much, or Lady B.
and demirepdom, though I should not object to
see it once, and then oftener if agreeable.”</p>

<p>But Carlyle was not always so complacent.
In August 1848, the Carlyles received from
Forster “An invaluable treat; an opera box,
namely, to hear Jenny Lind sing farewell.
Illustrious indeed. We dined with Fuz<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> at five,
the hospitablest of men; at eight, found the
Temple of the Muses all a-shine for Lind &amp; Co.—the
piece, <cite lang="it">La Sonnambula</cite>, a chosen bit of
nonsense from beginning to end—and, I suppose,
an audience of some three thousand <em>expensive</em>-looking
fools, male and female, come to see this
Swedish nightingale ‘hop the twig,’ as I phrased
it.… ‘Depend upon it,’ said I to Fuz, ‘the
Devil is busy <em>here</em> to-night, wherever he may be
idle!’ Old Wellington had come staggering in
to attend the thing. Thackeray was there;
D’Orsay, Lady Blessington—to all of whom
(Wellington excepted!) I had to be presented and
give some kind of foolery—much against the grain.”</p>

<p>A curious company this that D’Orsay moved in:
Brougham, Lyndhurst, Sumner, Carlyle, Landor,
Macready, Haydon, Bulwer, the Disraelis, father
and son; men of brains and men without, of
morals and of no morals; comedians and heavy
tragedians; he himself the prince of comedians,
though, as is often the case, beneath the light,
lilting melodies there surged a solemn, minatory
bass. An absolutely happy man this D’Orsay
ought to have been, but—?</p>

<span class="smaller">MORE FRIENDS</span></h2>

<p>Not only in the sports of the town but also in
those of the country, and with equal success, did
D’Orsay indulge, paying many a pleasant country
visit. Thus in January 1840 he was down in
Staffordshire hunting and shooting with Lord
Anglesey, Lord Hatherston and other good
sportsmen, and at the end of the same year he
spent some weeks in the country with Lord
Chesterfield. At Chesterfield House in town,
too, D’Orsay passed many a pleasant hour with
the generous, kindly Earl.</p>

<p>D’Orsay had a fondness for the theatre, both
the regions before and behind the curtain, and
for those connected with it in any way. J. R.
Planché, herald, dramatist and student of costume,
was at Gore House on 6th May 1840, there
being a brilliant company and much bright talk.
Bright companions and gay converse: no wonder
that D’Orsay said that “he had never known the
meaning of the word <i lang="fr">ennui</i>.” To the production
of Lytton’s <cite>Money</cite> D’Orsay lent a hand in 1840,
helping Macready in various ways to secure an
accurate representation of club-life and so forth,
introducing the actor to his hatter and so forth,
and showing the innocent man how play-accounts
and so forth were kept. Actors in those days must
have been as innocent of the ways of the world
as statesmen and politicians are in these times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Of another play of Bulwer’s, Charles Greville
records:—</p>

<p>“March 8th, 1839.—I went last night to the
first representation of Bulwer’s play <cite>Richelieu</cite>; a
fine play, admirably got up, and very well acted
by Macready, except the last scene, the conception
of which was altogether bad. He turned
Richelieu into an exaggerated Sixtus V., who
completely lost sight of his dignity, and swaggered
about the stage, taunting his foes, and hugging
his friends with an exultation quite unbecoming
and out of character. With this exception it was
a fine performance; the success was unbounded,
and the audience transported. After Macready
had been called on, they found out Bulwer, who
was in a small private box next the one I was
in with Lady Blessington and D’Orsay, and were
vociferous for his appearance to receive their
applause. After a long delay, he bowed two or
three times, and instantly retreated. Directly
after he came into our box, looking very serious
and rather agitated; while Lady Blessington
burst into floods of tears at his success, which
was certainly very brilliant.”</p>

<p>Macready himself notes of this occasion:
“Acted Cardinal Richelieu very nervously: lost
my self-possession, and was obliged to use too
much effort; it did not satisfy me at all. How
can a person get up such a play and do justice at
the same time to such a character!”</p>

<p>It was in truth a dazzling circle of dandies
with whom Lady Blessington and D’Orsay were
surrounded: Disraeli, Bulwer, Ainsworth, Dickens—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
fact Gore House was the haunt of the
novelists, for to the above may be added
Thackeray and Marryat. Ainsworth aped D’Orsay
in matters of costume and attitudinising, but as is
so often the case with imitators the copy did not
nearly equal the great original. The author of
<cite>Jack Shepherd</cite> and many other capital stories was
“a fine, tall, handsome, well-whiskered fellow,
with a profusion of chestnut curls, and bore himself
with no inconsiderable manifestation of self-consciousness.”
Ainsworth started business life
as a publisher, but made fame and money as a
writer. In order to correct the above somewhat
acrid description of him, here is a pleasanter one
of later years:—</p>

<p>“The time is early summer, the hour about
eight o’clock in the evening; dinner has been
removed from the prettily-decorated table, and
the early fruits tempt the guests, to the number
of twelve or so, who are grouped around it. At
the head there sits a gentleman no longer in his
first youth, but still strikingly handsome; there is
something artistic about his dress, and there may
be a little affectation in his manners, but even
this may in some people be a not unpleasing
element. He was our host, William Harrison
Ainsworth, and, whatever may have been the
claims of others, and, in whatever circles they
might move, no one was more genial, no one
more popular.”</p>

<p>Charles Dickens first visited Gore House in
1840, and soon gained and always retained the
friendship of D’Orsay. Dickens was a very vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
dresser, his gay spirit loved riotous colours. He
has been described as “rather florid in his dress,
and gave me an impression of gold chain and
pin and an enormous tie.” Dickens thoroughly
enjoyed the conviviality of Gore House, as is
shown by the following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Covent Garden</span>,<br />
“<i>Sunday, Noon, December 1844</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lady Blessington</span>,—Business
for other people (and by no means of a pleasant
kind) has held me prisoner during two whole
days, and will so detain me to-day, in the very
agony of my departure for Italy again, that I
shall not even be able to reach Gore House once
more, on which I had set my heart. I cannot
bear the thought of going away without some
sort of reference to the happy day you gave me
on Monday, and the pleasure and delight I had
in your earnest greeting. I shall never forget
it, believe me. It would be worth going to
China—it would be worth going to America,
to come home again for the pleasure of such a
meeting with you and Count d’Orsay—to whom
my love, and something as near it to Miss Power
and her sister as it is lawful to send.…”</p>

</div>

<p>And this message in another letter to Lady
Blessington, written in the following year:—</p>

<p>“Do not let your nieces forget me, if you can
help it, and give my love to Count d’Orsay, with
many thanks to him for his charming letter. I
was greatly amused by his account of ⸺.
There was a cold shade of aristocracy about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and a dampness of cold water, which entertained
me beyond measure.”</p>

<p>There were three dandies in this Gore House
circle of strangely different temperaments and
abilities. Dickens, a thorough Englishman in
almost every habit and instinct, who dressed
violently rather than well, sported somewhat
fantastic costumes simply because it was the
fashion so to do among the young men with
whom his growing fame had brought him into
contact. In the inner meaning of the word
Dickens was no dandy, but simply a dressy
man; his was not the dandiacal temper. Of
this, indeed, there was far more in the Oriental
Disraeli, though he, like his <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, used
high dressing as a pose. Whatever he undertook
he loved to do well, and in his youth even
to do to extremes. The effeminate dandy pose was
excellently acted in the following which he tells of
himself, writing from Malta to his father in 1830:—</p>

<p>“Affectation tells here even better than wit.
Yesterday, at the racket court, sitting in the
gallery among strangers, the ball entered, and
lightly struck me and fell at my feet. I picked
it up, and observing a young rifleman excessively
stiff, I humbly requested him to forward its
passage into the court, as I really had never
thrown a ball in my life. This incident has
been the general subject of conversation at all
the messes to-day!”</p>

<p>And this from Gibraltar:—</p>

<p>“Tell my mother that as it is the fashion
among the dandies of this place—that is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
officers, for there are no others—not to wear
waistcoats in the morning, her new studs come
into fine play and maintain my reputation of
being a great judge of costume, to the admiration
and envy of many subalterns. I have also
the fame of being the first who ever passed the
Straits with two canes, a morning and an evening
cane. I change my cane as the gun fires, and
hope to carry them both on to Cairo. It is
wonderful the effect these magical wands produce.
I owe to them even more attention than to being
the supposed author of—what is it?—I forget!”</p>

<p>Disraeli in his dress had a touch of the
fantastic, as thus, when he appeared at a dinner
party attired in a coat of black velvet lined
with satin, purple trousers with a gold stripe down
the seam, a scarlet waistcoat, lace ruffles down to
the fingers’ tips, white gloves with rings worn outside
them and his hair in long, black ringlets.</p>

<p>Dickens was only a clothes-deep dandy;
Disraeli was a true dandy as far as he went, but
he did not go all the way. He trifled with politics,
he did not realise that to be a perfect, complete
dandy, calls for the devotion of a lifetime.
D’Orsay made no such mistake; he was a dandy
through and through and all the way; a dandy
in love affairs, in his toilet, in his clothes, in his
sport, and in all the arts of life from cookery
down to sculpture. Thus it must be with every
great man; he aims at one target, pulls his bow
with all his strength, and shoots only at that
one mark. D’Orsay had but one aim, to lead
a life of dandified pleasure.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner writes in March 1840: “Lady
Blessington is as pleasant and time-defying as
ever, surrounded till one or two of the morning
with her brilliant circle.… Prince Napoleon is
always there, and of course D’Orsay.”</p>

<p>Says Edmund Yates, writing of the great folk
in Hyde Park at a later date:—</p>

<p>“There, in a hooded cabriolet, the fashionable
vehicle for men-about-town, with an enormous
champing horse, and the trimmest of tiny grooms—‘tigers,’
as they were called—half standing on
the footboard behind, half swinging in the air,
clinging on to the straps, would be Count d’Orsay,
with clear-cut features and raven hair, the king of
the dandies, the cynosure of all eyes, the greatest
‘swell’ of the day. He was an admirable whip—he
is reported on one occasion, by infinite spirit
and dash, to have cut the wheel off a brewer’s
dray which was bearing down upon his light
carriage, and to have spoken of it afterwards as
‘the triumph of mind over matter’—and always
drove in faultless white kid gloves, with his shirt
wristbands turned back over his coat-cuffs, and
his whole ‘turn-out’ was perfection. By his side
was occasionally seen Prince Louis Napoleon, an
exile too, after his escape from Ham, residing in
lodgings in King Street, St James’—he pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
out the house to the Empress Eugénie when, as
Emperor of the French, on his visit to Queen
Victoria, he drove by it. He was a constant
visitor of Lady Blessington’s at Gore House.
Albert Smith, in later years, used to say he
wondered whether, if he called at the Tuileries,
the Emperor would pay him ‘that eighteenpence,’
the sum which one night at Gore House he
borrowed from A. S. to pay a cabman.”</p>

<p>A strange, almost uncanny personage in some
ways, this Louis Napoleon, with his dogged, not
to be daunted belief in his high destiny.</p>

<p>George Augustus Sala thus describes him:—</p>

<p>“A short, slight form he had, and not a very
graceful way of standing. His complexion was
swarthily pale, if I may be allowed to make use of
that somewhat paradoxical expression. His hair
struck me as being of a dark brown; it was much
lighter in after years; and while his cheeks were
clean-shaven, the lower part of his face was concealed
by a thick moustache and an ‘imperial’
or chin-tuft. He was gorgeously arrayed in the
dandy evening costume of the period … he
wore a satin ‘stock,’ green, if I am not mistaken;
and in the centre of that stock was a
breastpin in the image of a gold eagle encircled
with diamonds.”</p>

<p>Shee notes in May 1839, of an evening at Gore
House: “Among the company last night was
Prince Louis Napoleon. He was quiet, silent,
and inoffensive, as, to do him justice, he generally
is, but he does not impress one with the idea that
he has inherited his uncle’s talents any more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his fortunes. He went away before the circle
quite broke up, leaving, like Sir Peter Teazle,
‘his character behind him,’ and the few remaining
did not spare him, but discussed him in a tone
that was far from flattering. D’Orsay, however,
who came in later with Lord Pembroke, stood up
manfully for his friend, which was pleasant to see.”</p>

<p>Said D’Orsay: “C’est un brave garçon, mais
pas d’esprit”; yet stood manfully by him.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that very
intimate relations existed between D’Orsay and
Louis Napoleon during his days of exile in
England. Napoleon III. was the son of Louis
Napoleon, King of Holland and his wife Hortense,
whom Lady Blessington met in Italy. Of
this meeting the following entry from Lady Blessington’s
Journal, dated Rome, March 1828, is a
quite interesting account:—</p>

<p>“Though prepared to meet in Hortense
Bonaparte, ex-Queen of Holland, a woman
possessed of no ordinary powers of captivation,
she has, I confess, far exceeded my expectations.
I have seen her frequently; and spent two hours
yesterday in her society. Never did time fly
with greater rapidity than while listening to her
conversation, and hearing her sing those charming
little French <i lang="fr">romances</i>, written and composed
by herself, which, though I had always admired
them, never previously struck me as being so
expressive and graceful as they now prove to be.
Hortense, or the Duchesse de St Leu, as she is
at present styled, is of the middle stature, slight
and well formed; her feet and ankles remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fine; and her whole <i lang="fr">tournure</i> graceful, and distinguished.
Her complexion and hair are fair,
and her countenance is peculiarly expressive; its
habitual character being mild and pensive, until
animated by conversation, when it becomes arch
and <i lang="fr">spirituelle</i>. I know not that I ever encountered
a person with so fine a tact, or so quick
an apprehension, as the Duchesse de St Leu:
these give her the power of rapidly forming an
appreciation of those with whom she comes in
contact; and of suiting the subjects of conversation
to their tastes and comprehensions. Thus,
with the grave she is serious, with the lively gay;
and with the scientific, she only permits just a
sufficient extent of her own <i lang="fr">savoir</i> to be revealed
to encourage the development of theirs. She is,
in fact, ‘all things to all men,’ without at the
same time losing a single portion of her own
natural character; a peculiarity of which seems to
be, the desire, as well as the power, of sending
away all who approach her satisfied with themselves,
and delighted with her. Yet there is no
unworthy concession of opinions made, or tacit
acquiescence yielded to conciliate popularity; she
assents to, or dissents from, the sentiments of
others, with a mildness and good sense that
gratifies those with whom she coincides, or disarms
those from whom she differs. The only
flattery she condescends to practise is that most
refined and delicate of all, the listening with
marked attention to the observations of those
with whom she converses; and this tacit symptom
of respect to others is not more the result of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
extreme politeness, than of a fine nature, attentive
to the feelings of those around her.…</p>

<p>“It is not often that a woman so accomplished
unites the more solid attraction of a highly-cultivated
mind: yet in Hortense this is the case;
for, though a perfect musician, a most successful
amateur in drawing, and mistress of three
languages, she is well read in history and <i lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>;
has an elementary knowledge of the
sciences, and a general acquaintance with the
works of the most esteemed authors of ancient
and modern times. Her remarks denote an
acute perception, and a superior understanding;
and are delivered with such a perfect freedom
from all assumption of the self-conceit of a <i lang="fr">bas-bleu</i>,
or the dictatorial style of one accustomed
to command attention, that they acquire an
additional charm from the modest grace with
which they are uttered.…</p>

<p>“She showed me her diamonds yesterday,
and some of them are magnificent, particularly
the necklace presented to the Empress Josephine
by the city of Paris. It is a <i lang="fr">rivière</i> of large
diamonds, of such immense value that none but a
sovereign, or some of our own princely nobility,
could become the purchaser. Her other diamonds
are very fine, and consist of many <i lang="fr">parures</i>, some
presented to her as Queen of Holland; and others
bequeathed to her, with the necklace, by her
mother. Her bed, furniture, and toilette service
of gilt plate, are very magnificent, and are the
same that served her in her days of regal state.
The arrangement of her apartments indicates a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
faultless taste, uniting elegance and comfort with
grandeur. She has some fine portraits of Napoleon
and Josephine in her possession: on our contemplating
them, she referred to her mother with as
much sensibility as if her death had been recent.</p>

<p>“Prince Louis Bonaparte lives with his
mother, and never did I witness a more devoted
attachment than subsists between them. He is a
fine, high-spirited youth, admirably well educated,
and highly accomplished, uniting to the gallant
bearing of a soldier all the politeness of a <i lang="fr">preux
chevalier</i>; but how could he be otherwise, brought
up with such a mother? Prince Louis Bonaparte
is much beloved and esteemed by all who know
him, and is said to resemble his uncle, the Prince
Eugène Beauharnois (<i lang="la">sic</i>), no less in person than
in mind; possessing his generous nature, personal
courage, and high sense of honour.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to follow in any detail the
career of Louis Napoleon, so we will skip on to
the year 1840, when on 6th August he made his
absurd descent upon France, landing at Boulogne
with about sixty followers.</p>

<p>Lord Malmesbury, who was often a visitor at
Gore House, mentions a curious little happening.</p>

<p>“<i>7th August.</i>—News arrived this morning of
Louis Napoleon having landed yesterday morning
at Boulogne with fifty followers. None of
the soldiers, however, having joined him, the
attempt totally failed, and he and most of those
who accompanied him were taken. This explains
an expression he used to me two evenings
ago. He was standing on the steps of Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Blessington’s house after a party, wrapped up
in a cloak, with Persigny by him, and I observed
to them: ‘You look like two conspirators,’ upon
which he answered: ‘You may be nearer right
than you think.’”</p>

<p>Disraeli writes on the same day:—</p>

<p>“The morning papers publish two editions,
and Louis Napoleon, who last year at Bulwer’s
nearly drowned us by his bad rowing, has now upset
himself at Boulogne. Never was anything so
rash and crude to all appearances as this ‘invasion,’
for he was joined by no one. A fine house in Carlton
Gardens, his Arabian horses, and excellent cook
was hardly worse than his present situation.”</p>

<p>He was captured, tried, condemned to perpetual
imprisonment, and consigned to the fortress
of Ham, where he remained for five years, and
then escaped to England.</p>

<p>On August 2nd, 1840, Planché relates that he
went between ten and eleven to Gore House,
where there had been a small dinner party, of
which four men had stayed on, Lord Nugent,
“Poodle” Byng, and two strangers. “The
youngest immediately engaged my attention.
It was the fashion in that day to wear black
satin kerchiefs for evening dress; and that of the
gentleman in question was fastened by a large
spread eagle in diamonds, clutching a thunderbolt
of rubies. There was but one man in
England at that period who, without the impeachment
of coxcombry, could have sported so
magnificent a jewel; and, though I had never
to my knowledge seen him before, I felt convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that he could be no other than Prince
Louis Napoleon. Such was the fact; and his
companion was Count Montholon.” Planché
walked home with Nugent and Byng, one of
whom remarked: “What could Louis Napoleon
mean by asking us to dine with him this day
twelvemonths at the Tuileries?” The ill-starred
landing at Boulogne a few days later
explained the mystery.</p>

<p>But earlier in this same year (1840), D’Orsay
had supported the Prince in another adventure.</p>

<p>For many years a peculiar Count Léon had
been looked on as one of the curiosities of Paris;
in appearance he was an enlarged replica of
Napoleon the Great, which was not surprising
seeing that he was reputed—probably wrongly—to
be his son by the Polish Countess Walewska.
Napoleon provided for the education of his
offspring, who in 1830 attained the dignity of a
colonelcy in the Legion of the Garde Nationale.</p>

<p>In February 1840, Count Léon came over to
London, it being absurdly stated afterward that
he had been entrusted by the Tuileries with the
pleasing duty of removing Louis Napoleon.</p>

<p>The Prince refused to receive the Count,
from whom after some heated correspondence he
received a challenge, borne by Lieutenant-Colonel
Ratcliffe. Léon refused to engage with
swords, so pistols were decided upon; the hour
chosen being seven o’clock on the morning of
3rd March, and the place Wimbledon Common.
Napoleon was accompanied by D’Orsay and
Colonel Parquin. It was not until the parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were on the ground that Count Léon raised the
difficulty about the weapons to be used, and the
delay caused by the discussion on the point gave
time to the authorities to arrive and put an end
to the contemplated breach of the peace. The
upshot of this fiasco was an appearance at Bow
Street. Before the Court proceeded to deal with
the ordinary night charges, Prince Louis and
Count Léon were charged before Mr Jardine
with having attempted a breach of the peace by
fighting a duel; Ratcliffe, Parquin, D’Orsay, and
Martial Kien, a servant, were brought in as being
aiders and abettors. They were all “bound
over,” Mr Joshua Bates, of Baring Brothers,
becoming surety for Prince Louis and Colonel
Parquin, and the Honourable Francis Baring for
D’Orsay. So ended the encounter.</p>

<p>On January 13th, 1841, Napoleon wrote from
Ham to Lady Blessington, in reply to a letter
from her:—</p>

<p>“I am very grateful for your remembrance,
and I think with grief that none of your previous
letters have reached me. I have received from
Gore House only one letter, from Count d’Orsay,
which I hastened to answer when I was at the
Conciergerie. I bitterly regret that my letter was
intercepted, for in it I expressed all the gratitude
at the interest he took in my misfortunes.… My
thoughts often wander to the place where you live,
and I recall with pleasure the time I have passed in
your amiable society, which the Count d’Orsay still
brightens with his frank and <i lang="fr">spirituel</i> gaiety.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of May 1846, there was gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
together a gay dinner-party at Gore House,
among those assembled, beside the host and
hostess, being Landor and John Forster. A
message was brought in to D’Orsay that a person,
who preferred not to give his name, desired to
see him. To the amazement of D’Orsay the
unknown turned out to be Louis Napoleon,
just landed after his escape from Ham. He
came in and entertained the party with a
vivacious account of his adventures.</p>

<p>Serjeant Ballantine describes a curious visit
paid to him at his chambers in June 1847 by
Louis Napoleon and D’Orsay, which certainly
strengthens the statements made by others that
the dandy was upon very intimate terms with the
prince. The visit was concerned with some of
Napoleon’s money-raising endeavours, which had
resulted in his being swindled by a rascally bill-discounter,
but in which the Serjeant could not
assist to right the wrong. Ballantine dubs
D’Orsay, “the prince of dandies,” adding that he
“never saw a man who in personal qualities surpassed
him”; continuing, he “was courteous to
everyone, and kindly. He put the companions
of his own sex perfectly at their ease, and
delighted them with his varied conversation, and
I never saw anyone whose manner to ladies was
more pleasing and deferential.”</p>

<p>Louis Philippe toppled over; a Republic
was set up in February 1848, and Napoleon
promptly and effectively took advantage of the
situation thus created to push himself to the
front. In December of the same year he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
elected President. The oath that he swore on
the occasion was: “In the presence of God and
before the French people represented by the
National Assembly, I swear to remain faithful to
the Democratic Republic, one and indivisible, and
to fulfil all the duties imposed on me by the
Constitution.” And on the 2nd of December
1851, he dissolved the said Assembly, upset the
Republic, and shortly became Napoleon III,
Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>Among Napoleon’s English advisers was
Albany Fonblanque, who through D’Orsay sent him
some suggestions as to the policy it would be wise for
the President of the French Republic to pursue.
How far that advice promised to produce fruit, the
following letter shows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>26th January 1849</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Cher Fonblanque</span>,—J’espère que vous
avez vu que notre conseil à été écouté; les
réductions dans l’armée et la marine sont très
fortes, et Napoleon à éprouvé, je vous assure, une
grande opposition pour en arriver là. L’armée,
qui était en 1845 de 502,196 hommes et de 100,
432 horses, sera réduite en 1849 à 380,824
hommes et 92,410 chevaux. Le Budget de la
Marine est diminué de vingt deux millions et
plus; la flotte en activité est réduite à dix
vaisseaux de ligne, huit frégates, etc.—et il y a
aussi une grande réduction dans les travaux des
arsenaux. Tout cela devrait plaire à John Bull
et à Cobden. Je vous promets que ces réductions
n’en resteront pas là; mais il faut considérer
la difficulté qu’il y a de toucher aux joujoux des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
enfants français, car chez nous l’armée est l’objet
principal; chez vous ce n’est qu’un accessoire.
Votre affectionné,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Madden, in his description of this “man-mystery,”
for once in a way is graphic. “I
watched his pale, corpse-like, imperturbable
features, not many months since, for a period
of three hours. I saw eighty thousand men in
arms pass before him, and I never observed a
change in his countenance or an expression in his
look which would enable the bystander to say
whether he was pleased or otherwise at the
stirring scene.… He did not speak to those
around him, except at very long intervals, and
then with an air of <i lang="fr">nonchalance</i>, of <i lang="fr">ennui</i> and
eternal occupation with self; he rarely spoke a
syllable to his uncle, Jérôme Bonaparte, who was
on horseback somewhat behind him.… He
gave me the idea of a man who had a perfect
reliance on himself, and a feeling of complete
control over those around him. But there was a
weary look about him, an aspect of excessive
watchfulness, an appearance of want of sleep, of
over-work, of over-indulgence, too, that gives an
air of exhaustion to face and form, and leaves an
impression on the mind of a close observer that
the machine of the body will break down soon,
and suddenly—or the mind will give way—under
the pressure of pent-up thoughts and energies
eternally in action, and never suffered to be
observed or noticed by friends or followers.”</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon is, as everybody knows, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Colonel Albert who plays so large a part in Lord
Beaconsfield’s unjustly neglected <cite>Endymion</cite>,
quite one of the most delightful of his novels,
although it contains that strange caricature of
Thackeray in the grotesque personage of St Barbe.</p>

<p>Says “Colonel Albert”:—“… I am the child
of destiny. That destiny will again place me on the
throne of my fathers. That is as certain as I am now
speaking to you. But destiny for its fulfilment ordains
action. Its decrees are inexorable, but they
are obscure, and the being whose career it directs is
as a man travelling in a dark night; he reaches
his goal even without the aid of stars and moon.”</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon emerged from the dark night
of his exile and sat in the limelight that beats
upon a throne, and he achieved his destiny without
accepting the aid or advice of his friend,
D’Orsay. He did not trust the latter with his
counsels and could scarcely have been expected
to ask him to accompany him to France.
D’Orsay would have been the central figure;
the Prince of the Dandies would have basked in
the popularity which the future Emperor of the
French knew he must focus upon himself.</p>

<p>After his escape to London from Ham, Louis
Napoleon, however, does seem to have consulted
with D’Orsay, and acting upon his advice to have
written to the French Ambassador to the Court
of St James, stating that it was his intention to
settle down quietly as a private individual; which
statement was doubtless taken for what it was
worth. D’Orsay may have helped, also, toward
Napoleon’s election as President by interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
friends in his cause, but of the schemes upon the
empty imperial throne D’Orsay appears to have
been ignorant. Indeed, he went so far as to
express his opinion of the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, that “it is
the greatest political swindle that ever has been
practised in the world!”</p>

<p>The following letter to Landor from Lady
Blessington is interesting:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>28th February 1848</i>.</p>

<p>“I will not admit that the eruption of the
Parisian volcano has brought out only cinders
from your brain, <i lang="fr">au contraire</i>, the lava is glowing
and full of fire—your honest indignation has been
ignited and has sent forth a bright flame.</p>

<p>“It gave me great pleasure to see your handwriting
again, for I had thought it long since I
had heard from you. I saw it stated to-day in
the <cite>Daily News</cite> that Count d’Orsay had set out
for Paris with Prince Louis. This report is wholly
untrue. Prince Louis has gone to Paris alone.
Here no one pities Louis Philippe, nor has the report
of his death mitigated the indignation excited against
him. His family are to be pitied, for I believe they
were not implicated in his crooked policy. Seldom
has vengeance so rapidly overtaken guilt.”</p>

</div>

<p>Still more interesting this from Landor to
Lady Blessington, written about a year later, on
9th January 1849—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Possibly you may never have seen the two
articles I enclose. I inserted in the <cite>Examiner</cite>
another, deprecating the anxieties which a truly
patriotic and, in my opinion, a singularly wise
man, was about to encounter, in accepting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Presidency of France. Necessity will compel him
to assume the Imperial Power, to which the voice
of the army and people will call him.</p>

<p>“You know (who know not only my writings,
but my heart) how little I care for station. I may
therefore tell you safely, that I feel a great interest,
a great anxiety, for the welfare of Louis Napoleon.
I told him if ever he were again in prison, I would
visit him there; but never, if he were upon a throne,
would I come near him. He is the only man living
who would adorn one, but thrones are my aversion
and abhorrence. France, I fear, can exist in no
other condition. Her public men are greatly
more able than ours, but they have less integrity.
Every Frenchman is by nature an intriguer. It
was not always so, to the same extent; but nature
is modified, and even changed, by circumstances.
Even garden statues take their form from clay.</p>

<p>“God protect the virtuous Louis Napoleon,
and prolong in happiness the days of my dear,
kind friend, Lady Blessington.</p>

<p class="right">“W. S. L.”</p>

<p>“I wrote a short letter to the President, and
not of congratulation. May he find many friends
as disinterested and sincere.”</p>

</div>

<p>Wellington also judged Napoleon’s rise to
power in France as propitious, and wrote to
D’Orsay on 9th April 1849:—“<i lang="fr">Je me réjouis de
la prospérité de la France et du succès de M. le
Président de la République. Tout tend vers la
permanence de la paix de l’Europe qui est
nécessaire pour le bonheur de chacun. Votre ami

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Though D’Orsay was not Napoleon’s active
ally, he watched his progress with interest, and,
despite the opinion he held of the means employed,
apparently with approbation also up to a
point. To Madden on the first day of the Presidential
election, a Sunday—but really we must
here have Madden’s own words:—“He came to
my house before church-time, and diverted me
from graver duties, to listen to his confident
anticipations of the result of that memorable day.
‘Think,’ said he, ‘what is the ordinary November
weather in Paris: and here is a beautiful day.
I have watched the mercury in my garden. I
have seen where is the wind, and I tell you,
that on Paris is what they will call the sun of
Austerlitz. To-morrow you shall hear that, while
we are now talking, they vote for him with almost
one mind, and that he has the absolute majority.’”</p>

<p>And later, he wrote to Richard Lane, the
artist: “<em>Rely upon it, he will do more for France
than any sovereign has done for the last two
centuries, if only they give him time.</em>”</p>

<p>Even previous to this exciting period, at the
time of the Boulogne descent, Lady Blessington
was shedding ink in the defence of D’Orsay; writing
to Henry Bulwer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>17th September 1840</i>.</p>

<p>“I am never surprised at evil reports, however
unfounded, still less so at any acts of friendship
and manliness on your part.… Alfred is
at Doncaster, but he charges me to authorise you
to contradict, in the most positive terms, the
reports about his having participated in, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
known, of the intentions of the Prince Louis.
Indeed, had he suspected them, he would have
used every effort in his power to dissuade him
from putting them into execution. Alfred, as
well as I, entertain the sincerest regard for the
Prince, with whom, for fourteen years, we have
been on terms of intimacy; but of his plans we
knew no more than you did. Alfred by no means
wishes to conceal his attachment to the Prince,
and still less that any exculpation of himself
should in any way reflect on him; but who so
well as you, whose tact and delicacy are equal to
your good-nature, can fulfil the service to Alfred
that we require?</p>

<p>“Lady C⸺ <a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> writes to me that <em>I</em>, too, am
mixed up in the reports. But I defy the malice
of my greatest enemy to prove that I ever
dreamt of the Prince’s intentions or plans.”</p>

</div>

<p>Both D’Orsay and Lady Blessington had to do
with Napoleon as Emperor.</p>

<p>D’Orsay, to a certain extent, tried to run both
with the fox and with the hounds, for, in 1841,
an attempt was made to procure for him the
appointment of Secretary to the French Embassy
in London. The Count St Aulaire was then
Ambassador, and much influence was brought to
bear upon him in this matter.</p>

<p>Among Lady Blessington’s papers was found
the following memorandum by her, which throws
considerable light upon this affair:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With regard to the intentions relative to our
Count, there is not even a shadow of truth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
them. Alfred never was presented here at Court,
and never would, though I, as well as his other
friends, urged it: his motive (for declining) being,
never having left his name at any of the French
Ambassadors of Louis Philippe (not even at Count
Sebastiani’s, a connection of his own) or at
Marshal Soult’s, also nearly connected with his
family, he could not ask to be presented at Court
by the French Ambassador, and did not think it
right to be presented by anyone else … and
the etiquette of not having been engaged to meet
the Queen, unless previously presented at Court,
is too well known to admit of any mistake.…
I enter into these details merely to show the utter
falsehoods which have been listened to against
Alfred. Now with regard to his creditors, his
embarrassments have been greatly exaggerated;
and when the sale of the northern estates in
Ireland shall have been effected, which must be
within a year, he will be released from all his
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In the meantime he has arranged
matters, by getting time from his creditors. So
that all the fuss made by the nomination, being
only sought as a protection from them, falls to
the ground.… I mention all these facts to
show how ill Alfred has been treated. If the
appointment in London is still deemed impracticable,
why should not they offer him the secretaryship
at Madrid, which is vacant?</p>

<p>“Alfred entrusted the affair (of the appointment)
to M⸺ and W⸺. He received positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
assurances from both that he would receive
an appointment in the French Embassy here,
and that it was only necessary, as a mere matter
of etiquette, that St Aulaire was to ask for his
nomination to have it granted. The assurances
were so positive that he could not doubt them,
and he accordingly acted on them. The highest
eulogies on Alfred’s abilities and power of rendering
service to the French Government were
voluntarily pronounced to St Aulaire by Lord
B⸺, the Duke of B⸺, and other persons of
distinction. M. St Aulaire, not satisfied with these
honourable testimonies, consulted a <i lang="fr">coterie</i> of foolish
women, and listening to their malicious gossiping,
he concluded that the nomination would not be
popular in London, and so was afraid to ask for it.</p>

<p>“It now appears that the Foreign Office at
Paris is an inquisition into the private affairs of
those who have the misfortune to have any reference
to it; a bad plan when clever men are so
scarce in France, and particularly those well-born
and well-connected: a Government like the
present should be glad to catch any such that
could be had.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Margt. Blessington.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>To which may be added a letter from Henry
Bulwer to Lady Blessington, written in December
1841:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lady Blessington</span>,—I think
D’Orsay wrong in these things you refer to: to
have asked for London especially, and not to
have informed me<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> how near the affair was to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
maturity when St Aulaire went to the D. of
B⸺’s, because I might then have prepared
opinion for it here; whereas, I first heard the
affair mentioned in a room, where I had to contend
against every person present, when I stated
what I think—that the appointment would have
been a very good one. But it does not now
signify talking about the matter, and saying that
I should have wished our friend to have given
the matter rather an air of doing a favour than of
asking one. It is right to say that he has acted
most honourably, delicately, and in a way which
ought to have served him, though, perhaps, it is
not likely to do so. The French Ambassador did
not, I think, wish for the nomination. M. Guizot,
I imagine, is, at this moment, afraid of anything
that might excite discussion and opposition, and
it is idle to disguise from you that D’Orsay, both
in England and here, has many enemies. The
best service I can do him is by continuing to
speak of him as I have done amongst influential
persons, viz., as a man whom the Government
would do well to employ; and my opinion is, that
if he continues to wish for and to seek employment,
he will obtain it in the end. But I
don’t think he will obtain the situation he wished
for in London, and I think it may be some little
time before he gets such a one as he ought to
have, and that would suit him. The Secretaryship
in Spain would be an excellent thing, and I
would aid the Marshal in anything he might do
or say respecting it. I shall be rather surprised,
however, if the present man is recalled. Well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
do not let D’Orsay lose courage. Nobody succeeds
in these things just at the moment he
desires: ⸺, with his position here” (speaking
of a French nobleman), “has been ten years
getting made an ambassador, and at last is so by
a fortunate chance. Remember also how long it
was, though I was in Parliament, and had some
little interest, before I was myself fairly launched
in the <em>diplomatic career</em>. Alfred has all the
qualities for success in anything, but he must
give the same trouble and pains to the pursuit
he now engages in that he has given to other
pursuits previously. At all events, though I
speak frankly and merely what I think to him,
I am here and always a sincere and affectionate
friend, and most desirous to prove myself so.”</p>

</div>

<p>To Madden, Henry Bulwer expressed the
opinion:—“It was altogether a great pity D’Orsay
was not employed, for he was not only fit to be
so, but to make a most useful and efficient agent,
had he been appointed.”</p>

<p>But Governments, as well as individuals, are
fallible, and often blind to their best interests.
Yet it really is difficult to understand why D’Orsay
was refused his modest request; what more distinguished
ornament to an Embassy could be
desired than a splendid libertine and a man distinguished
for the vastness of his debts? Unfortunately,
mediocrity succeeds often enough
when transcendent genius fails.</p>

<span class="smaller">W. S. L.</span></h2>

<p>Walter Savage Landor, who was born in 1775,
lived on hale and hearty till 1864. As he himself
wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I warm’d both hands before the fire of life;</div>
<div class="verse">It sinks, and I am ready to depart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was, as we have seen, the very good friend
of both D’Orsay and Lady Blessington, whom he
first met when he was living in Italy.</p>

<p>In a letter to Lady Blessington, in 1837,
Landor presented her with his autobiography in
brief:—</p>

<p>“Walter Landor, of Ipsley Court, in the
county of Warwick, married first, Maria, only
daughter and heiress of J. Wright, Esq., by
whom he had an only daughter, married to her
cousin, Humphrey Arden, Esq., of Longcroft,
in Staffordshire; secondly, Elizabeth, eldest
daughter and co-heiress of Charles Savage, of
Tachebrooke, who brought about eighty thousand
pounds into the family. The eldest son of this
marriage, Walter Savage Landor, was born 30th
January 1775. He was educated at Rugby—his
private tutor was Dr Heath, of St Paul’s.
When he had reached the head of the school, he
was too young for college, and was placed under
the private tuition of Mr Langley of Ashbourne.
After a year, he was entered at Trinity College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Oxford, where the learned Beonwell was his
private tutor. At the peace of Amiens, he went
to France, but returned at the end of the year.</p>

<p>“In 1808, on the first insurrection of Spain,
in June he joined the Viceroy of Gallicia, Blake.
The <cite>Madrid Gazette</cite> of August mentions a
gift from him of twenty thousand reals. On the
extinction of the Constitution, he returned to Don
P. Cavallos the tokens of royal approbation, in no
very measured terms. In 1811, he married Julia,
daughter of J. Thuillier de Malaperte, descendant
and representative of J. Thuillier de Malaperte,
Baron de Nieuveville, first gentleman of the bedchamber
to Charles the Eighth. He was residing
at Tours, when, after the battle of Waterloo,
many other Englishmen, to the number of four
thousand, went away. He wrote to Carnot that
he had no confidence in the moderation or honour
of the Emperor, but resolved to stay, because he
considered the danger to be greater in the midst
of a broken army. A week afterwards, when this
wretch occupied Tours, his house was the only
one without a billet. In the autumn of that year,
he retired to Italy. For seven or eight years, he
occupied the Palazzo Medici, in Florence, and
then bought the celebrated villa of Count
Gherardesea, at Fiesole, with its gardens, and
two farms, immediately under the ancient villa of
Lorenzo de Medici. His visits to England have
been few and short.”</p>

<p>This is but the bare bones of a very
interesting life; but its very bluntness seems to
illustrate the character of its writer, a member of
the <i lang="la">genus irritabile</i>, whom many hated, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
loved and most men admired. For several years
he made his home at Bath, living there from
1838 to 1858, when again he retired to Italy,
where he died at Florence.</p>

<p>He is, perhaps, best known to the world at
large under the slight disguise of Lawrence
Boythorn in <cite>Bleak House</cite>.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner describes him thus in 1838:—“Dressed
in a heavy frock-coat of snuff colour,
trousers of the same colour, and boots … with
an open countenance, firm and decided, and a
head grey and inclining to baldness … conversation
… not varied, but it was animated
and energetic in the extreme. We crossed each
other several times; he called Napoleon the
weakest, littlest man in history.”</p>

<p>Forster’s account is more vivid:—</p>

<p>“He was not above the middle stature, but had
a short stalwart presence, walked without a stoop,
and in his general aspect, particularly the set and
carriage of his head, was decidedly of what is
called a distinguished bearing. His hair was
already silvered grey, and had retired far upward
from his forehead, which wide and full but
retreating, could never in the earlier time have
been seen to such advantage. What at first was
noticeable, however, in the broad white massive
head, were the full yet strangely-lifted eyebrows.
In the large, grey eyes there was a depth of
compound expression that ever startled by its
contrast to the eager restlessness looking out
from the surface of them; and in the same variety
and quickness of transition the mouth was
extremely striking. The lips, that seemed compressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with unalterable will would in a moment
relax to a softness more than feminine; and a
sweeter smile it was impossible to conceive.”</p>

<p>Carlyle says that “he was really stirring company;
a proud, irascible, trenchant, yet generous,
veracious and very dignified old man; quite a
ducal or royal man in the temper of him.”</p>

<p>He was very frequently at Gore House, and
they must have made a curious trio, the fascinating
Lady Blessington, the ducal Landor and
dandy D’Orsay.</p>

<p>He addressed these lines to her:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What language, let me think, is meet</div>
<div class="verse">For you, well called the Marguerite.</div>
<div class="verse">The Tuscan has too weak a tone,</div>
<div class="verse">Too rough and rigid is our own;</div>
<div class="verse">The Latin—no—it will not do,</div>
<div class="verse">The Attic is alone for you.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of some of his many visits here are a few
notes:—</p>

<p>Writing Friday, 7th May 1841:—</p>

<p>“I did not leave my cab at Gore House gate
until a quarter past six. My kind hostess and
D’Orsay were walking in the garden and never
was more cordial reception. After dinner we
went to the English opera, <cite>The Siege of Rochelle</cite>
and <cite>A Day at Turin</cite>. Nothing could be worse
than the first except the second. The Hanoverian
minister, very attentive to Miss Power, a Carlist
viscount, and Lord Pembroke were the only
persons who stayed any time in the box,” and on
8th May he writes again from Gore House: “We
went this evening to the German Opera. Never
was music so excellent. The pieces were <cite>A
Night in Grenada</cite> and <cite>Fidelio</cite>. Madame Schodel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
sings divinely, and her acting is only inferior to
Pasta’s.… Both D’Orsay and Lord Pembroke
were enchanted with Madame Schodel, and Lady
B. and Miss Power, both good judges, and the
latter a fine composer, were breathless. To-night
we go to the Italian Opera.”</p>

<p>Landor writing from Gore House in June 1842:</p>

<p>“We have not been to the Opera this evening,
as Lord Pembroke and the Duc de Guiche came
to dinner. He is on a visit to Lord Tankerville,
but has the good taste to prefer the society he
finds here, particularly D’Orsay’s. D’Orsay was
never in higher spirits or finer plumage.”</p>

<p>On July 20th he writes:—</p>

<p>“A few days after my arrival in town, the
Duc de Grammont dined at Gore House. He is
on a visit to Lord Tankerville.… D’Orsay has
just finished an exquisite painting of the Duchesse.”</p>

<p>Then on September 7th:—</p>

<p>“I arrived at Gore House early on Monday.
In the morning, beside Lord Allen and some
other people, there called Lord Auckland.…
At dinner the Duc de Guiche, Sir Francis Burdett
and Sir Willoughby Cotton.… Those were
bright hours; even my presence could not
interrupt their brilliancy.… The Duc de
Guiche left us this morning to shoot with his
cousin, Lord Ossulton.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> We miss the liveliness
of his conversation—he talked Memoirs.”</p>

<p>When he was not at Gore House he kept up
a very lively correspondence with his two friends,
some of which it will be useful to quote, for in
familiar letters we become almost on speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
terms with their writers, and who of us would not
be glad to chat with Lady Blessington, Landor
and D’Orsay?</p>

<p>This from her to him, when sending him her
portrait:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I send you the engraving, and have only
to wish that it may sometimes remind you of the
original. You are associated in my memory with
some of my happiest days; you were the friend,
and the highly-valued friend, of my dear and
lamented husband, and as such, even without
any of the numberless claims you have to my
regard, you could not be otherwise than highly
esteemed. It appears to me that I have not quite
lost him, who made life dear to me, when I am
near those he loved<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and that knew how to value
him. Five fleeting years have gone by since our
delicious evenings on the lovely Arno, evenings
never to be forgotten, and the recollections of
which ought to cement the friendships then
formed. This effect I can, in truth, say has been
produced on me, and I look forward, with confidence,
to keeping alive, by a frequent correspondence,
the friendship you owe me, no less
for that I feel for you, but as the widow of one
you loved, and that truly loved you. We, or
more properly speaking I, live in a world where
friendship is little known, and were it not for one
or two individuals like yourself, I might be
tempted to exclaim with Socrates: ‘My friends,
there are no friends.’ Let us prove that the
philosopher was wrong, and if Fate has denied
us the comfort of meeting, let us by letters keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
up our friendly intercourse. You will tell me
what you think and feel in your Tuscan retirement,
and I will tell you what I do, in this
modern Babylon, where thinking and feeling are
almost unknown. Have I not reason to complain
that in your sojourn in London you do not
give me a single day? And yet methinks you
promised to stay a week, and that of that week I
should have my share. I rely on your promise
of coming to see me again before you leave
London, and I console myself for the disappointment
of seeing so little of you, by recollecting the
welcome and the happiness that await you at
home. Long may you enjoy it, is the sincere
wish of your attached friend,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">M. Blessington</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>He to her, in the shape of “bits” out of a long
letter written from Florence in March 1835:—</p>

<p>“Poor Charles Lamb, what a tender, good,
joyous heart had he! What playfulness! what
purity of style and thought! His sister is yet
living, much older than himself. One of her tales
is, with the sole exception of the <cite>Bride of
Lammermoor</cite>, the most beautiful tale in prose
composition in any language, ancient or modern.
A young girl has lost her mother, the father
marries again, and marries a friend of his former
wife. The child is ill reconciled to it, but being
dressed in new clothes for the marriage, she runs
up to her mother’s chamber, filled with the idea
how happy that dear mother would be at seeing
her in all her glory—not reflecting, poor soul,
that it was only by her mother’s death that she
appeared in it. How natural, how novel is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
this! Did you ever imagine that a fresh source
of the pathetic would burst forth before us in this
trodden and hardened world? I never did, and
when I found myself upon it, I pressed my temples
with both hands, and tears ran down to my elbows.</p>

<p>“The Opium-eater calls Coleridge ‘the largest
and most spacious intellect, the subtlest and most
comprehensive that has yet existed among men.’
Impiety to Shakespeare! treason to Milton! I
give up the rest, even Bacon. Certainly, since
their day, we have seen nothing at all comparable
to him. Byron and Scott were but as gun-flints
to a granite mountain; Wordsworth has one angle
of resemblance; Southey has written more, and
all well, much admirably.…</p>

<p>“Let me add a few verses as usual:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Pleasures—away, they please no more:</div>
<div class="verse">Friends—are they what they were before?</div>
<div class="verse">Loves—they are very idle things,</div>
<div class="verse">The best about them are their wings.</div>
<div class="verse">The dance—’tis what the bear can do;</div>
<div class="verse">Music—I hate your music too.</div>
<div class="verse">Whene’er these witnesses that time</div>
<div class="verse">Hath snatch’d the chaplet from our prime</div>
<div class="verse">And called by nature (as we go</div>

<div class="verse">Shall we desire to leave the scene</div>
<div class="verse">Where all our former joys have been?</div>
<div class="verse">No! ’twere ungrateful and unwise:</div>
<div class="verse">But when die down our charities</div>
<div class="verse">For human weal and human woes,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis then the hour our days should close.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this:—</p>

<p>“D’Orsay’s mind is always active. I wish it
would put his pen in motion. At this season of the
year (January) I fancied he was at Melton. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
not he lament that this bitter frost allows him no
chance of breaking his neck over gates and double
hedges? Pray offer him my kind remembrances.”</p>

<p>And here a chatty little note from D’Orsay:—</p>

<p>“It is a fact, that my brave nephew has been
acting the part of Adonis, with a <i lang="fr">sacré cochon</i>,
who nearly opened his leg;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> his presence of
mind was great, he was on his lame leg in time
to receive the second attack of the infuriated beast,
and killed him on the spot, plunging a <i lang="fr">couteau de
chasse</i> through his heart—luckily the wild boar
had one. The romantic scene would have been
complete, if there had been another Gabrielle de
Vergy looking at this modern Raoul de Courcy.
We think and speak of you often, and are in

<h2 id="XXI">XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ARTIST</span></h2>

<p>It behoves us now to pay some attention to
D’Orsay’s claims as an artist; if he had posed
simply as an amateur, silence would be possible,
but he worked for money, entered the lists with
other artists, and therefore laid himself open to
judgment. In his own day he was highly thought
of by many—here we have what was written of
him in <cite lang="fr">La Presse</cite> on November 10th, 1850, when
D’Orsay’s bust of Lamartine was exhibited:—</p>

<p>“M. le comte d’Orsay est un amateur de l’art
plutôt qu’un artiste. Mais qu’est-ce qu’un amateur?
C’est un volontaire parmi les artistes; ce sont
souvent les volontaires qui font les coup d’éclat
dans l’atelier comme sur les champs de bataille.
Qu’est ce qu’un amateur? C’est un artiste dont
le génie seul fait la vocation. Il est vrai qu’il ne
reçoit pas dans son enfance et pendant les
premières années de sa vie cette éducation du
métier d’où sort Michel Ange, d’où sort Raphaél
… mais s’il doit moins au maître, il doit plus à
la nature. Il est son œuvre.… M. d’Orsay
exerça dans les salons de Paris et de Londres la
dictature Athénienne du goût et de l’élégance.
C’est un de ces hommes qu’on aurait cru préoccupé
de succès futiles,—parce que la nature semble les
avoir créés uniquement pour son plaisir—mais qui
trompent la nature, et qui, après avoir recueilli les
légères admirations des jeunes gens et des femmes
de leur âge, échappent à cette atmosphère de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
légèreté avant le temps où ils laissent ses idoles
dans le vide, et se transforment par l’étude et par
le travail en hommes nouveaux, en hommes de
mérite acquis et sérieux. M. d’Orsay a habité
longtemps l’Angleterre ou il donnait l’exemple et
le ton à cette société aristocratique, un peu raide
et déforme, qui admire surtout ce qui lui manque,
la grâce et l’abandon des manières.…</p>

<p>“Dès cet époque, il commenca à jouer avec
l’argile, le marbre, le ciseau, liè par un attachement
devenu une parenté d’esprit, avec une des
plus belles et des plus splendides femmes de son
époque, il fit son buste pendant qu’elle vivait; il
le fit idéal et plus touchant après sa mort. Il
moula en formes après, rudes, sauvages, de grandeur
fruste, les traits paysanesque d’O’Connell.
Ces bustes furent à l’instant vulgarisés en
millièrs d’exemplaires en Angleterre et à Paris.
C’étaient des créations neuves.…</p>

<p>“Ces premiers succès furent des plus complets.
Il cherchait un visage. Il en trouva
un. Lord Byron, dont il fut l’ami et avec lequel
il voyagea pendant deux ans<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> en Italie, n’était
plus qu’un souvenir aimé dans son cœur.… Il fit
le buste de Lamartine,…” and then there is
something approaching very closely to a rhapsody
on this work of art, and then a set of verses by
Lamartine himself!</p>

<p>Debt drove D’Orsay to seek in art a means of
adding to his income; in the case of Mr. Mitchell
of Bond Street, who published a series of portrait
drawings, it is even possible that he used his art
to cancel his debt for Opera boxes, etc.! These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
portraits were 14 inches high and 10½ inches wide
and were sold at 5s. each. The set must have
been almost a pictorial “Who’s Who,” and among
those honoured with inclusion may be named
Byron, Disraeli, Theodore Hook, Carlyle, Liszt,
D’Orsay himself, the Duke of Wellington, Greville,
Louis Napoleon, Bulwer Lytton, Trelawney,
Landor, Dickens, Lady Blessington, Henry
Bulwer, Captain Marryat and Sir Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p>Richard James Lane, the engraver and lithographer,
saw much of D’Orsay, and judging by
the following letter held him in esteem:—</p>

<p>“As a patron, his kind consideration for my
interest, and prompt fulfilment of every engagement,
never failed me for the more than twenty
years of my association with him; and the friendship
that arose out of our intercourse (and which
I attest with gratitude) proceeded at a steady
pace, without the smallest check, during the
same period; and remained unbroken, when on
his final departure from England, he continued to
give me such evidence of the constancy of his
regard, as will be found conveyed in his letters.</p>

<p>“In the sketches of the celebrities of Lady
Blessington’s <i lang="fr">salons</i>, which he brought to me
(amounting to some hundred and fifty, or more),
there was generally an appropriate expression and
character, that I found difficult to retain in the
process of elaboration; and although I may have
improved upon them in the qualities for which I
was trained, I often found that the final touches of
his own hand alone made the work satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Of the amount and character of the assistance
of which the Count availed himself, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
production of his pictures and models, I have a
clear notion.…</p>

<p>“When a gentleman would rush into the
practice of that which, in its mechanism, demands
experience and instruction, he avails himself of the
help of a craftsman, whose services are sought for
painting-in the subordinate parts, and working
out his rude beginnings. In the first rank of art,
at this day, are others who, like the Count d’Orsay,
have been unprepared, excepting by the possession
of taste and genius, for the practice of art,
and whose merits are in no way obscured by the
assistance which they <em>also</em> freely seek in the
manipulation of their works; and it is no less
easy to detect, in the pictures of the Count, the
precise amount of mechanical aid which he has
received from another hand, than the graces of
character and feeling that are superadded by his
own. I have seen a rough model, executed
entirely by himself, of such extraordinary power
and simplicity of design, that I begged him to
have it <em>moulded</em>, and not to proceed to the details
of the work, until he could first place this model
side by side with the cast in clay, to be worked
up. He took my advice, and his equestrian statue
of the first Napoleon may fairly justify my opinion.</p>

<p>“In art, he had a heartfelt sympathy, a searching
eye, and a critical taste, fostered by habitual
intercourse with some of our first artists.”</p>

<p>This letter from D’Orsay to Lane shows the
Count in an amiable light:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>21st February 1850</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Lane</span>,—I cannot really express to
you the extent of my sorrow about your dear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
good family. You know that my heart is quite
open to sympathy with the sorrows of others.
But judge therefore, how it must be, when so
great a calamity strikes a family like yours, which
family I always considered one of the best I ever
had the good fortune to know. What a trial for
dear Mrs Lane, after so many cares, losing a son
like yours, just at the moment that he was to
derive the benefit of the good education you gave
him.… There is no consolation to offer. The
only one that I can imagine, is to think continually
of the person lost, and to make oneself more
miserable by thinking. It is, morally speaking,
an homœopathic treatment, and the only one which
can give some relief.… Give my most affectionate
regards to your dear family, and believe me always—far
or near. Your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In 1843 D’Orsay writes jestingly of himself: “I
am poetising, modelling, etc., etc. In fact, I begin
to believe that I am a Michael Angelo <i lang="fr">manqué</i>.”</p>

<p>Concerning the Wellington statuette, D’Orsay
writes to Madden: “You must have seen by the
newspapers that I have completed a great work,
which creates a revolution in the Duke of Wellington’s
own mind, and that of his family. It is
a statuette on horseback of himself, in the costume
and at the age of the Peninsular war. They say
that it will be a fortune for me, as every regiment
in the service will have one, as the Duke says
publicly, that it is the only work by which he
desires to be known, physically, by portraits.
They say that he is very popular in Portugal
and Spain. I thought possibly that you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sell for me the copyright at Lisbon, to some
speculator to whom I could send the mould.”</p>

<p>Shortly before his death he completed a smaller
equestrian statuette of the Duke, an account of
which was given in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> of
23rd December 1852:—</p>

<p>“One of the last of the late lamented Count
d’Orsay’s studies was a statuette of the Duke on
horseback, the first copy of which, in bronze, was
carefully retouched and polished by the artist. The
work is remarkable for its mingled grace and sprightliness.
The Duke, sitting firmly back in his saddle,
is reining in a pawing charger, charmingly modelled,
and a peculiar effect is obtained by the rider dividing
the reins, and stretching that on the left side
completely back over the thigh. The portrait is
good, particularly that of the full face, and very
carefully finished, and the costume is a characteristic
closely-fitting military undress, with hanging
cavalry sabre. Altogether, indeed, the statuette
forms a most agreeable memorial, not only of the
Duke, but, in some degree, of the gifted artist.”</p>

<p>Henry Vizetelly roundly states that there was
no secrecy about the help rendered to D’Orsay in
his equestrian statuettes, etc., by T. H. Nicholson,
a draughtsman of horses, and that the faces of
these works of art were modelled by Behnes. He
goes on to say: “The statuette of the Duke
of Wellington on horseback was undoubtedly
Nicholson’s, and that famous bust of the Iron
Duke which was to make the fortune of the lucky
manufacturer who reproduced it in porcelain, is
said to have been his and Behnes’ joint work.”</p>

<p>Then follows this amusing story:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir Henry Cole—Old King Cole of the
Brompton toilers,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and Felix Flummery of the
art-manufacture craze—used to tell an amusing
story of the high estimate, artistic and pecuniary,
which D’Orsay set upon this production. The
Count had written to ask him to call at Gore
House, and on his proceeding there, after handing
his card through the wicket, he was cautiously
admitted to the grounds and safely piloted between
two enormous mastiffs to the door of the house.
He was then conducted to the Count, whom he
found pacing up and down Lady Blessington’s
drawing-room in a gorgeous dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“D’Orsay, Cole used to say, at once broke out
with—‘You are a friend of Mr Minton’s! I can
make his fortune for him!’ Then turning to his
servant, ‘François,’ said he, ‘go to my studio and
in the corner you will find a bust. Cover it over
with your handkerchief and bring it carefully here.’
François soon returned carrying his burthen as
tenderly as though it were a baby, and when he
had deposited it on the table, the Count removed
the handkerchief and posing before the bust with
looks of rapt admiration, he promptly asked Cole—</p>

<p>“‘What do you think of that?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a close likeness,’ Cole cautiously replied.</p>

<p>“‘Likeness! indeed it is a likeness!’ shouted
the Count, ‘why, Douro when he saw it exclaimed:
“D’Orsay, you quite appal me with the likeness to
my father!”’</p>

<p>“The Count then confided to Cole that the
Duke had given him four sittings, after refusing,
said he, a single sitting to ‘that fellow Landseer.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Duke it seems came to inspect the bust
after it was completed. In D’Orsay’s biassed eyes
he was as great in art as he was in war, and he
always went, the Count maintained, straight up
to the finest thing in the room to look at it.
Naturally, therefore, he at once marched up to
the bust, paused, and shouted:—</p>

<p>“’”By God, D’Orsay, you have done what
those damned busters never could do.“’</p>

<p>“The puff preliminary over, the Count next
proceeded to business.</p>

<p>“‘The old Duke will not live for ever,’ he
sagely remarked; ‘he must die one of these days.
Now, what I want you to do is to advise your
friend Minton to make ten thousand copies of
that bust, to pack them up in his warehouse and
on the day of the Duke’s death to flood the country
with them, and heigh presto! his fortune is made.’</p>

<p>“The Count hinted that he expected a trifle
of £10,000 for his copyright, but Cole’s friend,
Minton, did not quite see this, and proposed a
royalty upon every copy sold. D’Orsay, who
was painfully hard up for ready cash, indignantly
spurned the offer.…”</p>

<p>D’Orsay is most generally known as an artist
by reason of his large portrait of the Duke of
Wellington now in the National Portrait Gallery,
upon the completion of which the Duke is said to
have shaken hands with the painter, saying: “At
last I have been painted like a gentleman! I’ll
never sit to anyone else.” And he certainly did
write to Lady Blessington:—“You are quite
right. Count d’Orsay’s work is of a higher
description of art than is described by the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
portrait! But I described it by that word, because
the likeness is so remarkably good, and so well
executed as a painting, and that this is the truest
of all artistic ability, truest of all in this country.”
Which last sentence is rather enigmatical.</p>

<p>Anent the statuette of O’Connell, referred to
already, may be quoted a letter written by D’Orsay
on 16th March 1847 to John Forster:—</p>

<p>“Prince Napoleon told me to-night at the
French play, that he read in an evening paper,
the <cite>Globe</cite>, I think, an article copied from an Irish
paper, stating that I had made a statuette of
O’Connell, and praising it, etc. I suppose that it
is from Osborne Bernal,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who is in Ireland. But
I would be glad it were known that I have associated
him in the composition with the Catholic
Emancipation, and also that I intend to make a
present of the copyright to Ireland, for the benefit
of the subscription for the poor.”</p>

<p>Of other works from his hand we may name
the bust of Emile de Girardin, a portrait of Sir
Robert Peel, and the picture of which some details
have already been given, showing a group in the
garden of Gore House.</p>

<p>We have already quoted an account of one
visit paid by D’Orsay to Haydon, here is that of
a second, from an entry in the painter’s Diary,
dated 31st June 1838:—</p>

<p>“About seven, D’Orsay called, whom I had
not seen for long. He was much improved, and
looking the glass of fashion and the mould of
form; really a complete Adonis, not made up at
all. He made some capital remarks, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
must be attended to. They were sound impressions,
and grand. He bounded into his cab, and drove
off like a young Apollo, with a fiery Pegasus. I
looked after him. I like to see such specimens.”</p>

<p>In conclusion on this subject, from the <cite>New
Monthly Magazine</cite> of August 1845, this:—</p>

<p>“Whatever Count d’Orsay undertakes, seems
invariably to be well done. As the arbiter elegantiarum
he has reigned supreme in matters of
taste and fashion, confirming the attempts of others
by his approbation, or gratifying them by his
example. To dress, or drive, to shine in the gay
world like Count d’Orsay was once the ambition
of the youth of England, who then discovered in
this model no higher attributes. But if time, who
‘steals our years away,’ steals also our pleasures,
he replaces them with others, or substitutes a
better thing; and thus it has befallen with Count
d’Orsay.</p>

<p>“If the gay equipage, or the well-apparelled
man be less frequently seen than formerly, that
which causes more lasting satisfaction, and leaves
an impression of a far more exalted nature, comes
day by day into higher relief, awakening only the
regret that it should have been concealed so long.
When we see what Count d’Orsay’s productions
are, we are tempted to ask, with Malvolio’s feigned
correspondent, ‘Why were these things hid?’”</p>

<p>All things considered we may write down
Count d’Orsay as a quite first-rate amateur, as
skilful in the arts as any dandy has ever been.
What more fitting than that his skill and accomplishment
were best shown in his bust of Lady
Blessington?</p>

<p>D’Orsay, had he devoted his time and his mind
to the matter, could doubtless have attained high
eminence as a painter and sculptor, but he was
wise and refused to be bitten by the temptation;
he well knew that there are many artists, but few
dandies. The gifts that other men would have
cultivated exclusively, he used to heighten and
perfect his genius as a master of dandyship. It is
perhaps the highest attribute of genius to be able
to recognise genius—in oneself; only mediocre
men are modest. Modesty is a sign of incompetency
or stupidity.</p>

<p>Could D’Orsay have achieved greatness as a
writer? Byron thought very highly of the journal
which, it will be remembered, D’Orsay wrote during
his first visit to London, but we cannot accept
this criticism as final, for the poet’s literary judgment
was often faulty.</p>

<p>He is reputed to have been a contributor to
some of the journals of the day and he was put
forward as the “editor” of the translation published
in London in 1847 of a French novel, <cite lang="fr">Marie,
Histoire d’une Jeune Fille</cite>. But other men have
gained fame with as little regular literary baggage
as the Count, literature in the form of familiar
letters, written always, or almost always, without a
thought that they would meet the public eye. Of
casual letters we have a fair number of D’Orsay’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and some of them make quite pleasant reading.
At any rate they are as good as those which are
not written by dandies, which is saying much, for
dandies have many important affairs to fill
their time. They are chatty epistles, serve to
shed a light upon their writer’s character;
by his letters to his friends you may know the
man.</p>

<p>Here is a note from him to Landor, written in
September 1828:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have received, dear Mr Landor, your
letter. It has given us great pleasure. You
ought to feel sure that we should particularly
appreciate a letter from you, and it will appear
that our intimacy in Florence counted for nothing
with you if you doubt the pleasure that your
news arouses in us. As soon as I have received
the pictures I will carry out your commission
carefully. I do wish you would come to Paris,
for we have some fine things to show you, particularly
pictures. Apropos, I am sending you
herewith the portrait of Prince Borghese, which I
hope you will find to be a good likeness.…
We talk and think often of you. It is really
strange that you are in the odour of sanctity in
this family, for it seems to me it is not exactly
this sort of reputation you pique yourself on
possessing.</p>

<p>“Lady B. and all our ladies send you a
thousand good wishes and I renew the assurance
of the sincerity of mine.—Yours very
affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“All our ladies,” included Lady d’Orsay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Then of a much later date, probably 1842 or
1843:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think that Henry the Eighth was at
Richmond-on-the-Hill when Anne Boleyn was
beheaded. They say that he saw the flag which
was erected in London as soon as her head fell.
Therefore, as you make him staying at Epping
Forest at that time, and as I am sure you have
some good reasons for it, I will thank you to give
them to me.</p>

<p>“We regretted much not to have seen you at
Bath, and I was on the moment to write to you,
like Henry the Fourth did to the brave Crillon
after the battle!</p>

<p>“‘Pends toi, brave Landor, nous avons été à
Bath, et tu n’y étois pas—’</p>

<p>“You will be glad to hear that the second son
of my sister has been received at the Ecole of St
Cyr, after a ticklish examination. Hoping to see
you soon, believe me, yours most affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is not very much of distinction, perhaps,
in these two letters, but they serve to show the
familiar friendship of the two men and also that
the dandy studied his English History, at any
rate as far as concerns the disposal of wives.</p>

<p>With John Forster he kept up a fairly lively
correspondence, some of the letters containing
points of interest:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>25th October 1844</i>.</p>

<p>“It is really an age since you’ve been here.
It’s a poor joke! Where <em>have</em> you been?…
Macready has sent me a Boston paper, in which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
have read with great interest of his success.…
I have not seen ‘De la Roche’ Maclise. Give
him a thousand good wishes.</p>

<p>“Eugene Sue gets better and better; he leads
you to his moral by somewhat perilous roads, but
once you get there you find it pure and beautiful.
The fecundity of his imagination surpasses all
previous works; the Jesuits are smashed up, the
convents broken down and the workman raised
upon their debris. Amen.—Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Was it not to this practical Forster that D’Orsay
wrote upon his project for establishing a means of
communication between the guard and the engine-driver
of a train? But the “sacrés directeurs de
rail road” would not adopt his idea because of
their own ideas of economy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“P.M., <i>4th August 1845</i>.</p>

<p>“I am determined to follow up the directors
until they take up my scheme, and if you will
assist me” (<i lang="la">i.e.</i> by writing in the papers), “these
continual accidents will establish a ‘raw,’ which we
will tickle continually with cayenne pepper, and in
the end they will take real steps to heal the
wound. My idea is this, that they shall have a
seat behind the last carriage of every train, just
like the coachman’s of a hansom cab. It would
be in communication with the engine by a long
cord passing along the whole length of the roof of
the carriages; on pulling the cord a hammer would
strike a gong by the engine and would indicate
that a halt must be made.…”</p>

</div>

<p>There was also to be an arrangement of lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and a cord—very similar to that now in use—for
the benefit of travellers in trouble. Quite sufficient
in all this to prove that a dandy need not be
a fool.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>25th September 1845</i>.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to tell you that Lady Blessington
a reçu des nouvelles” (from here the letter is in
French); “very alarming concerning the health of
Lady Canterbury. There is no doubt she is
gradually sinking, surrounded by those who choose
to blind themselves to her condition.… It
will be best, I think, for you to tell our dear
Dickens why for the moment we must abandon
our plans. I should most willingly have gone
with you to Knebworth, we will arrange to go
there together when I can manage a day.…”
Knebworth was Lord Lytton’s country seat.</p>

<p>The letter continues, throwing a light upon
the dark side of our comedy:—</p>

<p>“Think of poor Lady Blessington losing in so
short a time her niece, her little niece, her nephew,
her brother-in-law, and her sister dying.…”</p>

<p>Then again he returns to his railway scheme:—</p>

<p>“I was just going to write to you from the
country, where I have been some time, to tell you
that Lady C⸺ and Lady Sophie de V⸺
went to Derby by rail; they were in the last
carriage of the train. One of the connections is
broken, the carriage is tossed from right to left
and left to right so violently, that the two unhappy
people think they are lost, and wave their handkerchiefs
out of the window. They call out; no
one sees them; no one hears them, and happily
they reach the station, not a moment too soon—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
carriage could not have held out. You will
see that a guard in such a case would have saved
this? Do you think we had better drop the
subject or take it up again? <i lang="fr">Au revoir</i>, brave
Forster.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bournemouth, Hants</span>, <i>9th September 1848</i>.</p>

<p>“We are in the most charming neighbourhood

<p>Of Mathews’ friendship with D’Orsay in Italy,
an account has already been given; the following
letters show that it was continued on paper:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>17th November 1831.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Charles</span> … I have lost my poor
friend Blessington and my mother within two
months; they died in my arms, and when I think
of them it is always their last moments that come
to my mind. I would it were in other times, but
that is difficult.…”</p>

</div>

<p>The following from London:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>1st September.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Charles</span> … I was the other
day at Goodwood.… Since I learnt that you
had taken the Adelphi I agreed with Lord
Worcester that we would do all we could to
interest society in your favour by thinking and
talking about it. I understand that the first idea
of Y(ates)<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is to put you at a disadvantage, he
himself will leave you, in order to make you feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that he is indispensable; this season is a trial that
he gives you, hoping that in case of a failure you
will give everything up into his hands. No
matter what happens you must remedy this.
Reeves, also, goes to America. Mrs Honey is
engaged elsewhere; in short, most of the old
names connected with the theatre are going. I
therefore recommend you to make an arrangement
with the proprietor of the Queen’s Theatre, who
would join his company with yours; union gives
strength, and thanks to your talents you will
triumph completely over the trap which Y(ates)
has set for you. The Queen’s Theatre has been
very successful this season; to-day they have
taken £90; it is wonderful for the time of year.
Chesterfield, Worcester and myself have a box
there and we wish to have one at the Adelphi,
and speaking this evening on the matter to Bond,
he told me that he would be delighted to join his
company with yours and then to close the Queen’s
Theatre. Think it over, see if you would not find
it to your advantage, and let me know.—Your

<p>The Adelphi was opened by Yates and
Mathews on 28th September 1835; the house
was full, but the season was not satisfactory.</p>

<p>The details of acting and stage production
were not beneath D’Orsay’s notice:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Charles</span>,—I like your new piece
very much, and you acted very well. You must
ask the orchestra to accompany you a little less

would do well, also, in my opinion, to cut out
two verses of the Welsh song. Your Frenchwoman

seen presented in an English theatre. Use your

<p>Dr Quin was the first homœopathic practitioner
in England, and in his early days was denounced
as a quack. He was endowed with an inexhaustible
fund of good humour, was a wit and a
master of repartee. In a postscript to another
letter D’Orsay writes:—</p>

<p>“You have, my friend, an unbearable mania,
that of always defending the absent. Don’t
you know that there is a French proverb which
says, ‘Les absens ont toujours tort?’ This
fashion never goes out, and, the devil, you who are
the ‘pink of fashion,’ you must be in the mode.”</p>

<p>Jekyll declared to Lady Blessington that he
“was asked gravely if quinine was invented by
Doctor Quin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is a quaint little note to the Doctor:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gore House</span>, <i>Saturday</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Dr Quin</span>,—M. Pipelet (D’Orsay)
requests that you will send him the letter about
Mr ⸺ you promised he should have. I
suppose it is in vain to tell you we are going to
the Opera to-night. Of course you have 999 impatient
patients who <em>must</em> see you every five
minutes throughout the course of the day and
night, and as many more friends who expect you
to dinner. However, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, I venture to
hint that we go with Mdme. Calabrella, so
if you manage to kill off the maladies, and put
the friends under the table in turn, we shall be
delighted to see you ready and waiting, as Homer
says in the fifth book of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, line forty-nine.
Farewell, may you be happy whilst I—Sobs
choke my utterance. Adieu.”</p>

<span class="smaller">EXCHEQUER BONDS</span></h2>

<p>D’Orsay might have been a great artist and a
great man of letters; of his genius as a financier
there is no doubt. He solved the question of
how to obtain unlimited credit; he paid such
debts as he did cancel with money which legally
was his, but which almost any other man would
not have cared to touch.</p>

<p>Lord Blessington is said, when he persuaded
D’Orsay to abandon his career in the French
army, to have undertaken to provide for the
Count’s future, and he fulfilled his promise at the
expense of his daughter’s happiness and of the
family estates.</p>

<p>In the return made of “The Annuities, Mortgages,
Judgments and other Debts, Legacies,
Sums of Money, and Incumbrances, charged upon
or affecting the Estates of the said Charles John,
Earl of Blessington, at the Time of his Decease,”
we find that the mortgages and sums of money
charged on D’Orsay’s account from 1837 to 1845,
amounted to the quite respectable sum of £20,184.
In Blessington’s will all his estates in Dublin,
bringing in a rental of £13,322, 18s. 8d. were left
to whichever of his daughters married D’Orsay.</p>

<p>By the marriage settlement £20,000 was to
be paid to trustees, the Duc de Guiche, and
Robert Power, within twelve months of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
solemnisation, and a further £20,000 on Blessington’s
decease; the money to be invested in the
funds, and the interest thereupon to be paid to
D’Orsay during his life.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the happy couple separated
actually in 1831, legally in 1838.</p>

<p>In 1834 an order was made by the Court of
Chancery in Ireland, upon which was thrown the
task of clearing up the mess made of his property
by Blessington, granting D’Orsay an income of
£500, and to his wife £450.</p>

<p>How great that mess was, for which D’Orsay
and his wife were partly to blame, will be seen
from the following facts. The Countess had run
up debts to the tune of £10,000, which sum,
however, is scarcely worth mentioning beside
that incurred by her husband. By the deed of
separation between them, D’Orsay relinquished
all his claims on the Blessington estates, in
consideration—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>i. Of £2467 of annuities granted by him
being redeemed, which cost £23,500.</p>

<p>ii. In consideration of the sum of £55,000
being paid to him, £13,000 of which
was to be raised as soon as possible, and
£42,000 within ten years.</p>

</div>

<p>A grand total of money which all went in one
way or another to pay off D’Orsay’s debts.</p>

<p>As to the estate: the trustees were empowered
by Act of Parliament to make sales to the amount
of £350,000 to pay off all encumbrances and
claims. Thus ended the glory of the Blessington
fortune; thus often has it been in Ireland.</p>

<p>D’Orsay found fortune and lost it; he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
not even retain the wife with which it was
encumbered.</p>

<p>Over £100,000 of debts we know he paid,
and still he owed very much. For at least two
years previous to his final departure from England
he went in constant dread of arrest at the instigation
of sordid persons, who had not sufficient
understanding of the fact that it was an honour
to them to help in the support of a great man.
There are too many petty-minded people in the
world! Just heavens! That a man of D’Orsay’s
calibre should be confined to his house and
grounds all the days of the week save Sunday,
excepting that he could creep forth under cover
of darkness! That the Prince of the Dandies
should go in danger of the vile clutch of a sinister
myrmidon of the law and of the degradation of
a sponging-house.</p>

<p>In 1845 D’Orsay apparently realised that his
pecuniary condition was irreparable, and sought
in vain for means of escape. He prepared a
schedule of his liabilities, the total sum of his
indebtedness amounting to £107,000, not including
a number of debts to private friends,
which made an additional sum of £13,000. It
was even contemplated that he should go
through the Court of Bankruptcy, but a difficulty
was found in the fact that it could not be
proved that he was a commercial man or an
agriculturalist. He only sowed wild oats.</p>

<p>The situation so pressed upon him, that he
allowed himself for a time to become the prey of
impostors, who declared that they had achieved
what the alchemists of old had so long looked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in vain, the conversion of the baser metals into
gold!</p>

<p>From an unveracious chronicle we quote a
passage which is veracious:—</p>

<p>“Now, among the shyest birds that ever
ducked from a missile of the law was, without an
exception the Marquis d’Horsay (D’Orsay).
His maxim had long been ‘catch me who can;’
at the same time, acting up to the patent-safety
rule of ‘prevention being so much better than
cure,’ he afforded no facilities whatever of being
hobbled in the chase. At bay he kept the yelping
pack, and within the good, stout, rich walls of
his covert he maintained both a pleasant and a
secure retreat from the dangers besetting him.
He now no longer ventured to frame himself, as
it were, in his cab, and exhibit his colours and
attractions to the curious crowds, except on that
privileged day—when even the debtor is at liberty
to rest—the seventh of the week.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Then, indeed,
he issued forth, decked as of old, and, like a bird
free from the confines of his cage, made the most
of the brief hours of his freedom.</p>

<p>“Every art, every manœuvre within the subtle
and almost inexhaustible resources of those apt
functionaries of the law who are ever on the alert
to deprive the subject of his liberty, let him be
never so chary of the preservation of it, had been
put in force to trap our hero; but hitherto in
vain. Mr Sloughman,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> truly, arrived within a
short journey of accomplishing this much-desired
end; still he was frustrated, and now among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
ranks of bums there was a cloud which damped
their hopes and mildewed their energies. The
Marquis was not to be grabbed, and they knew
it. With flagging spirits the attempts were
renewed over and over again. Bribes and offers
of rewards were extended liberally to his menials
for their traitorous assistance in obtaining the
design, but they had been too well selected, and
knew their own interests depended on no such
frail or fleeting benefits. False messengers in all
garbs and disguises, upon all kinds of errands and
excuses, applied for admission and interviews.
Even—yes, even the fair sex were at last made
not bearers of Love’s despatches, but conveyancers
of stern writs, notices of declarations, trials, and
suchlike means to the end and breaking up
of a man of fashion. Still the Marquis was proof
against all these attacks, let them come in what
shape they would.”</p>

<p>That may be fancy, but it is close akin to fact.</p>

<p>In <cite>The English Spy</cite> we read of the crowd
in Hyde Park of a Sunday afternoon at the
fashionable hour:—</p>

<p>Henry Vizetelly used on occasion to make an
early call upon Thackeray, and walk into town
with him from Kensington. “On one of these
journeys,” he says, “soon after Lady Blessington
gave up Gore House to reside in Paris, I remember
his taking me with him to look over the
little crib, adjacent to the big mansion, where
Count d’Orsay, Lady Blessington’s recognised
lover, was understood to have resided, with the
view of saving appearances. For years past the
ringleted and white-kidded Count, although his
tailor and other obliging tradespeople dressed him
for nothing, or rather, in consideration of the advertisement
that his equivocal patronage procured for
them, had been a self-constituted prisoner through
dread of arrest for debt. It was only on Sundays
that he ventured outside the Gore House grounds,
and for his protection on other days the greatest
possible precaution was exercised when it was
necessary for any of Lady Blessington’s many
visitors to be admitted. D’Orsay’s friend, Thomas
Slingsby Duncombe, who was mixed up with
him in numerous bill transactions, used to say
that the Count’s debts amounted to £120,000,
and that before he retired to the safe asylum
of Gore House, he was literally mobbed by
duns.”</p>

assembled, and sunned themselves in her charms;
and where, for certain reasons, she was secure from
the intrusion of rivals. There Count d’Orsay,

to welcome his ‘<i lang="fr">cher Tomie</i>.’”</p>

The following letters tell a tale of woe:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Saturday, 12th February 1842.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Tommy</span>,—I know that you have
been to C. Lewis, and that he told you it was
settled. It is not so; he expected that I would
have signed the renewals at sixty per cent. which
he sent me, and which I delivered. Therefore,
if you have a moment to lose, have the kindness
to see him this morning and persuade him of the
impossibility of my renewing at that rate; say
anything you like on the subject, but that is the
moral of the tale. You must come and dine with
us soon again.—Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Thursday, 6th April 1842.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Tommy</span>,—I see by the papers that
Lord Campbell and Mr T. S. Duncombe received
a petition against the <em>Imprisonment for Debt</em>!
It is the moment to immortalise yourself, and
also the <em>sweetest</em> revenge against all our gang of
Jews, if you succeed in carrying this petition
through. I have taken proper means to keep
this proposal alive in the Press. Will you come

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>This last <em>may</em> refer to the schedule above-mentioned:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Tommy</span>,—I send you this precious

</div>

<p>The following refers again to the Imprisonment
Abolition Bill:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Cher Tommy</span>,—I think that we ought
to try to ascertain how far the humbugging
system can go. As soon as I received your note
this morning I wrote to Brougham, and explained
all the unfructuous attempts of Mr Hawes.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I
enclose the first answer. <em>Now</em>, he has just been
here, after having had a long conversation with
Lyndhurst, who is decided to spur the Solicitor-General,
stating, as the Parliament will last until
Thursday week, there will be time enough to
pass the bill. See what you can do with Mr
Hawes. I am sure that if he will strike the iron
now, when it is hot, that we have still a chance.
Lyndhurst, I assure you, is very anxious about it,
and expressed it strongly to Brougham. Do not
be discouraged.—Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The enclosed note from Brougham ran:—</p>

<div class="blockquote" lang="fr">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Cher A.</span>,—Je suis <em>coloré</em> plutôt que
<em>désespéré</em>. Il faut que je mette ordre à tout cela.
Je vais chez Lyndhurst dans l’instant, H. B.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Duncombe was himself a capital hand
at getting into debt; we read:—“Duncombe is
playing good boy, having completely drawn in;
he has given up his house and carriages, and
taken his name out of the Clubs. He had become
so involved that he could not carry on the
war any longer. They say that he has committed
himself to the amount of 120,000<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p>Readers of <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> will recall “Mr
Moss’s mansion in Cursitor Street,” “that dismal
place of hospitality,” to which Colonel Crawdon
was an unwilling visitor. It was such an ordeal,
that D’Orsay was determined not to undergo.
Shame upon those who threatened him with it.</p>

<p>Madden tells us that D’Orsay’s sister “makes
no concealment of her conviction that Count
d’Orsay’s ignorance of the value of money—the
profuse expenditure into which he was led by
that ignorance, the temptation to play arising
from it, the reckless extravagance into which he
entered, not so much to minister to his own
pleasure, as to gratify the feelings of an inordinate
generosity of disposition, that prompted him to
give whenever he was called on, and to forget
the obligations he contracted for the sake of
others, and the heavy penalties imposed on his
friends by the frequent appeals for pecuniary
assistance—were very grievous faults, and great
defects in his character.”</p>

<p>Mice nibbling at the reputation of a lion!
Faults and defects; it is so easy to see spots on
the sun! The world is often cruel to its greatest
men; and who can deny that D’Orsay was much
ill-used? Who can realise the suffering inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
on his generous heart by the lack of generosity
in others? How absurd to insult his memory by
calling “reckless extravagance” that which in
ordinary men would be so, but which in him was
the striving to fulfil his great destiny. If his
spirit haunts the earth it must be torture, worse
than any in the place to which he may have gone,
to find that he should have been so greatly misunderstood.
It is a lovable trait in a man that
he should give to others of his superfluity; it is
adorable in D’Orsay that he should have distributed
with open hand and tender heart the spare
cash of others. Petty questionings as to right
and wrong, <i lang="la">meum et tuum</i>, to which commonplace
men rightly pay attention, have no claim upon
such a man as D’Orsay. To the good all things
are good.</p>

<p>He had the tongue of the charmer. Mr
Mitchell, to whom he owed much money, would
in moments of despair, write and demand immediate
payment. In all his glory D’Orsay would
answer in person; would calm the tempest with
fair words and would usually succeed in <em>increasing</em>
his indebtedness.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXIV">XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">SUNDRY FESTIVITIES</span></h2>

<p>There cannot, indeed, be any question but that
D’Orsay possessed the gift of fascination; his
personality was one that compelled both admiration
and attention. It is impossible to define or
describe wherein exactly lies this power of personality.
Of two women equally beautiful and
apparently equally attractive, one will fascinate
and the other will not, but it surpasses the ability
of even those who are fascinated to say wherein
is the difference between the two charmers.</p>

<p>D’Orsay had charm, and for our part we
believe that with him, at any rate, part of this
charm lay in the fact that he did not grow old;
those whom the gods love die young despite the
passage of years. He was young and he was
gay; and joyousness is singularly and strongly
attractive in a world where the majority of men
and women are apt to be unjoyous. Gaiety of
spirits, and unconquerable, unquenchable <i lang="fr">joie de
vivre</i>, are treasures above all price because they
cannot be purchased.</p>

<p>Especially with those who make pleasure a
pursuit, and it was with such that D’Orsay chiefly
forgathered, the amusements of life too frequently
become “stale, flat and unprofitable”; such folk
make pleasure the business of life, pleasure does
not come to them naturally, spontaneously; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
suffer from that most wearing of mental troubles,
boredom. Far otherwise was it with D’Orsay.
We have been with him now in many places and
with many companies, and never once has there
been a hint that he was either satiated with enjoyment
or depressed when things went astray.
He often said himself: “I have never known the
meaning of the word <i lang="fr">ennui</i>.”</p>

<p>Beneath all the tinsel and unreality of some of
Disraeli’s novels, there is always a stratum of
keen observation and shrewd knowledge of men
and women. It will help us, therefore, in our
understanding of D’Orsay to see how he appeared
to his friend and fellow-dandy.</p>

<p>Disraeli sketched D’Orsay’s portrait as Count
Alcibiades de Mirabel in <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>: “The
satin-lined coat thrown open … and revealing
a breastplate of starched cambric …,” the
wristbands were turned up with “compact precision,”
and were fastened by “jewelled studs.”
“The Count Mirabel could talk at all times well.…
Practised in the world, the Count Mirabel
was nevertheless the child of impulse, though a
native grace, and an intuitive knowledge of
mankind, made every word pleasing and every
act appropriate.… The Count Mirabel was
gay, careless, generous.… It seemed that the
Count Mirabel’s feelings grew daily more fresh,
and his faculty of enjoyment more keen and relishing.…”
Into Count Mirabel’s mouth is put
this, which sounds very D’Orsayish: “Between
ourselves, I do not understand what this being
bored is,” said the Count. “He who is bored
appears to me a bore. To be bored supposes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
inability of being amused.… Wherever I may
be, I thank heaven that I am always diverted.”
Then this: “I live to amuse myself, and I do
nothing that does not amuse me.” And this:
“Fancy a man ever being in low spirits. Life is
too short for such <i lang="fr">bêtises</i>. The most unfortunate
wretch alive calculates unconsciously that it is
better to live than to die. Well then, he has
something in his favour. Existence is a pleasure,
and the greatest. The world cannot rob us of
that, and if it be better to live than to die, it is
better to live in a good humour than a bad one.
If a man be convinced that existence is the
greatest pleasure, his happiness may be increased
by good fortune, but it will be essentially independent
of it. He who feels that the greatest
source of pleasure always remains to him, ought
never to be miserable. The sun shines on
all; every man can go to sleep; if you cannot
ride a fine horse, it is something to look upon
one; if you have not a fine dinner, there is
some amusement in a crust of bread and
Gruyère. Feel slightly, think little, never
plan, never brood. Everything depends upon
the circulation; take care of it. Take the
world as you find it, enjoy everything. <i lang="fr">Vive la
bagatelle!</i>”</p>

<p>Then further on:—</p>

<p>“The Count Mirabel was announced.…</p>

<p>“The Count stood before him, the best-dressed
man in London, fresh and gay as a bird, with
not a care on his sparkling visage, and his eye
bright with <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>. And yet Count Mirabel
had been the very last to desert the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
mysteries of Mr Bond Sharpe;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and, as usual,
the dappled light of dawn had guided him to his
luxurious bed—that bed that always afforded him
serene slumbers, whatever might be the adventures
of the day, or the result of the night’s
campaign. How the Count Mirabel did laugh
at those poor devils, who wake only to moralise
over their own folly with broken spirits and
aching heads. Care, he knew nothing about;
Time, he defied; indisposition he could not comprehend.
He had never been ill in his life, even
for five minutes.</p>

<p>“Melancholy was a farce in the presence of
his smile; and there was no possible combination
of scrapes that could withstand his kind and
brilliant raillery.”</p>

<p>Then to his friend, Armine, who is <i lang="fr">distrait</i>:—</p>

<p>“A melancholy man! <i lang="fr">Quelle bêtise!</i> I will
cure you; I will be your friend, and put you all
right. Now we will just drive down to Richmond;
we will have a light dinner—a flounder,
a cutlet, and a bottle of champagne, and then we
will go to the French play. I will introduce you
to Jenny Vertpré. She is full of wit; perhaps
she will ask us to supper. Allons, mon ami, mon
cher Armine; allons, mon brave!”</p>

<p>Could Armine resist a tempting invitation so
irresistible? No, “so, in a few moments, he was
safely ensconced in the most perfect cabriolet in
London, whirled along by a horse that stepped
out with a proud consciousness of its master.”</p>

<p>We hold that portrait to be excellent not only
as regards the outer but also the inner man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
D’Orsay. He was the “child of impulse,” not a
cold, cynical, calculating voluptuary; he did not
deliberately “feel slightly, think little”; it was
not in him to suffer deep emotion or to think
deeply. “<i lang="fr">Vive la bagatelle!</i>” that was his
motto, because for him there was not in life anything
else than “<i lang="fr">bagatelle</i>”; existence for him
was compounded of “trifles light as air.” His
good spirits, as Disraeli hints, were based upon
his splendid physical vitality as infectious good
spirits must ever be. The joy of life may be
apparent to and partially enjoyed by those whose
physical health is weak, but complete realisation
of the joy of living, of merely being alive, is only
for those whose vitality is abundant and superb.
Further, he had the faculty of enjoying himself;
it was not that he would not but that he could
not be bored.</p>

<p>Even children felt his fascination. Madden
writes:—</p>

<p>“One of the proofs of the effect on others of
his insinuating manners and prepossessing appearance,
was the extreme affection and confidence he
inspired in children, of whom he was very fond,
but who usually seemed as if they were irresistibly
drawn towards him, even before he attempted to
win them. The shyest and most reserved were
no more proof against this influence than the most
confiding. Children who in general would hardly
venture to look at a stranger, would steal to his
side, take his hand, and seem to be quite happy
and at ease when they were near him.”</p>

<p>Nor, as we have learned, was it merely the
butterflies who found pleasure in his sunny nature;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
he had a striking faculty of suiting himself to his
company, an adaptability which is essential for
success in general society. Landor loved him, so
almost it may be said did the somewhat stern
Macready. Indeed the actor was one of the most
ardent of D’Orsay’s admirers; he wrote after his
death:—</p>

<p>“No one who knew and had affections could
help loving him. When he liked he was most
fascinating and captivating. It was impossible
to be insensible to his graceful, frank and most
affectionate manner. I have reason to believe
that he liked me, perhaps much, and I certainly
entertained the most affectionate regard for him.
He was the most brilliant, graceful, endearing
man I ever saw—humorous, witty and clear-headed.
But the name of D’Orsay alone had a
charm; even in the most distant cities of the
United States all inquired with interest about
him.”</p>

<p>A few notes from Macready’s Diary, and from
records kept by others, will serve to confirm the
testimony already adduced of the great variety
and interest of the friends with whom D’Orsay
was surrounded in the Gore House days.</p>

<p>On February 16th, 1839, there was a pleasant
company there, of which Macready makes this
record:—</p>

<p>“Went to Lady Blessington’s with Forster,
who had called in the course of the day. Met
there the Count de Vigny, with whom I had a
most interesting conversation on <cite>Richelieu</cite>.…
Met also with D’Orsay, Bulwer, Charles Buller,
Lord Durham, who was very cordial and courteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to me, Captain Marryat, who wished to be reintroduced
to me, Hall, Standish, Chorley, Greville,
who wished to be introduced to me also, Dr Quin,
etc. Passed a very agreeable two hours.”</p>

<p>With most of these we have already met on
other occasions. On May 31st, 1840, Macready
met at Gore House the Fonblanques, Lord
Normanby, Lord Canterbury, Monckton Milnes,
Chorley, Rubini and “Liszt, the most marvellous
pianist I ever heard. I do not know when I have
been so excited.” And in April 1846, we hear of
him dining at Gore House in the company of,
amongst others, Liston, Quin, Chesterfield, Edwin
Landseer, Forster, Jerdan and Dickens.</p>

<p>And on the other hand many a time did
D’Orsay dine with Macready to meet good
company, but Lady Blessington was not and
could not be included in the invitations. It is a
feather in their caps for men to conquer beautiful
ladies, but <i lang="la">væ victis</i>. On the evening of May 6th,
1840, Planché “was present at a very large and
brilliant gathering at Gore House. Amongst the
company were the Marquis of Normanby and
several other noblemen, and, memorably, Edwin
Landseer. During the previous week there had
been a serious disturbance at the Opera, known as
‘The Tamburini Row,’ and it naturally formed
the chief subject of conversation in a party, nearly
every one of whom had been present. Lord
Normanby, Count d’Orsay, and Landseer were
specially excited; there was some difference of
opinion, but no quarrelling, and the great animal
painter was in high spirits and exceedingly amusing
till the small hours of the morning, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
all gaily separated, little dreaming of the horrible
deed perhaps at that very moment perpetrating,
the murder of Lord William Russell by his valet
Courvoisier.”</p>

<p>Of James Robinson Planché, herald and writer
of extravaganzas and student of the history of
costume, Edmund Yates gives a thumbnail
sketch in later years:—</p>

<p>“Such a pleasant little man, even in his extreme
old age—he was over eighty at his death<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>—and
always neatly dressed, showing his French origin
in his vivacity and his constant gesticulation.”</p>

<p>The murder of Lord William Russell created
an unpleasant sensation, though there was not
anything mysterious in it, or particularly interesting
to the amateur in crime. François Benjamin
Courvoisier, a Swiss and Lord William’s valet,
two maid-servants and Lord William, aged
seventy-two, formed the household at the establishment
in Norfolk Street, Park Lane. On the
morning of 7th May, the housemaid found her
master’s writing-room in a state of disarray, and
in the hall a cloak, an opera-glass and other
articles of wearing apparel done up together as if
prepared to be taken away. The maid roused
Courvoisier, who exclaimed, when he came upon
the scene: “Some one has been robbing us; for
God’s sake go and see where his lordship is!”</p>

<p>They went together to Lord William’s room,
where a shocking sight presented itself, their
master lying dead upon the bed, his head nearly
severed from his body. The police were
summoned, and money, banknotes, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
jewellery, believed to have been stolen from Lord
William, being found concealed behind the skirting
in the pantry, Courvoisier was arrested,
tried, condemned, and then acknowledged his
crime. He was executed on 6th July, before an
immense mob of men, women and children.</p>

<p>Of another evening at Gore House Planché
has this to relate of Lablache:—</p>

<p>“It was after dinner at Gore House that I
witnessed his extraordinary representation of a
thunderstorm simply by facial expression. The
gloom that gradually overspread his countenance
appeared to deepen into actual darkness, and the
terrific frown indicated the angry lowering of the
tempest. The lightning commenced by winks of
the eyes, and twitchings of the muscles of the
face, succeeded by rapid sidelong movements of
the mouth which wonderfully recalled to you the
forked flashes that seem to rend the sky, the
motion of thunder being conveyed by the shaking
of his head. By degrees the lightning became
less vivid, the frown relaxed, the gloom departed,
and a broad smile illuminating his expansive face
assured you that the sun had broken through the
clouds and the storm was over.”</p>

<p>Another house to which D’Orsay frequently
went was that of Charles Dickens, and we read
of in 1845 an entertainment which no doubt was
a festive jollification. In September of that year
an amateur performance, with Dickens at the head
of the troupe, was given of <cite>Every Man in His
Humour</cite>, at Miss Kelly’s Theatre, in Dean Street,
Soho, now known as the Royalty. After the
“show” it was decided to wind up with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
supper, concerning which Dickens writes to
Macready:—</p>

<p>“At No. 9 Powis Place, Great Ormond Street,
in an empty house belonging to one of the company.
There I am requested by my fellows to
beg the favour of thy company and that of Mrs
Macready. The guests are limited to the actors
and their ladies—with the exception of yourselves
and D’Orsay and George Cattermole, ‘or so’—that
sounds like Bobadil a little.”</p>

<p>In the company were included Douglas
Jerrold, John Leech and Forster.</p>

<p>Referring to yet another dinner, Lady
Blessington writes to Forster from Gore House,
on 12th April 1848:—</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay repeated to me this morning
the kind things you said of him when proposing
his health. He, I assure you, was touched when
he repeated them, and his feelings were infectious,
for mine responded. To be highly appreciated
by those we most highly value, is, indeed, a source
of heartfelt gratification. From the first year of
our acquaintance with you, we had learned to
admire your genius, to respect your principles,
and to love your goodness of heart, and the
honest warmth of your nature. These sentiments
have never varied. Every year, by unfolding
your noble qualities to us, has served to prove
how true were our first impressions of you, and
our sole regret has been that your occupations
deprive us of enjoying half as much of your society
as all who have once enjoyed it must desire.
Count d’Orsay declares that yesterday was one
of the happiest days of his life. He feels proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of having assisted at the triumph of a friend whose
heart is as genial as his genius is great. Who
can resist being delighted at the success of one
who wins for himself thousands of friends (for all
his readers become so), without ever creating an
enemy, even among those most envious of another’s
fame, and simply by the revelations of a
mind and heart that excite only the best feelings
of our—nature? I cannot resist telling you what
is passing in my heart. You will understand this
little outbreak of genuine feeling in the midst of
the toil of a literary life.”</p>

<p>There were almost as many writers of genius
then as now!</p>

<p>Forster and Dickens were together at Gore
House early in 1848, when Madden tells us
“there was a remarkable display of D’Orsay’s
peculiar ingenuity and successful tact in drawing
out the oddities or absurdities of eccentric or
ridiculous personages—mystifying them with a
grave aspect, and imposing on their vanity by
apparently accidental references of a gratulatory
description to some favourite hobby or exploit,
exaggerated merit or importance of the individual
to be made sport of for the Philistines of the
fashionable circle.” Bear-baiting was succeeded
in those polite days by bore-baiting. Anent this
particular evening, one of those present wrote to
Lady Blessington:—</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay may well speak of our evening
being a happy one, to whose happiness he
contributed so largely. It would be absurd, if
one did not know it to be true, to hear D⸺
(Dickens?) talk as he has done ever since of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Count d’Orsay’s power of drawing out always the
best elements around him, and of miraculously
putting out the worst. Certainly I never saw it
so marvellously exhibited as on the night in
question. I shall think of him hereafter unceasingly,
with the two guests that sat on either
side of him that night.”</p>

<p>It was but fitting that the Prince of Dandies
and the future Poet Laureate should come together.
Tennyson writes:—“Count d’Orsay is
a friend of mine, co-godfather to Dickens’ child
with me.” This was Dickens’ sixth child and
fourth son, christened Alfred Tennyson after his
godfathers.</p>

<p>D’Orsay was not so unkind as to neglect his
native country entirely, and we find him now and
again running over to Paris.</p>

<p>As pendants to the Disraeli portrait of D’Orsay,
here are two others, one from a man’s hand, the
other from a woman’s.</p>

<p>Chesterfield House was the headquarters of a
racing set, and was gossiped about as also the
centre of some heavy gambling, probably untruly
so.</p>

<p>The Honourable F. Leveson Gore in <cite>Bygone
Years</cite> expresses himself bluntly: “I used to wonder
that Lady Chesterfield admitted into her house
that good-for-nothing fellow, Count d’Orsay. He
was handsome, clever and amusing, and I am
aware that in the eyes of some people such
qualities cover a multitude of sins. But his record
was a bad one. No Frenchman would speak
to him because he had left the French army at
the breaking out of the war between his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
country and Spain, in order to go to Italy with
Lord and Lady Blessington, and his conduct
with regard to his marriage was infamous.” How
uncharitable is the judgment of a virtuous world.
Reading on we find that the writer holds that
Lady Blessington induced D’Orsay “entirely to
neglect his young wife. She, moreover, endeavoured
to undermine her faith and her morals
by getting her to read books calculated to do so,
and what was still worse, she promoted the
advances of other men, who made up to this
inexperienced and beautiful young woman. Her
life at Gore House<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> became at last so intolerable
that she fled from it never to return.”</p>

<p>Mr Leveson Gore also calls Lady Harriet the
only daughter of Lord Blessington, which is really
not doing his lordship justice.</p>

<p>It is much more helpful, however, to have the
opinion of a keen, shrewd woman; one who cannot
have been disposed to like D’Orsay, yet who
seems, as did her husband, to have a soft place
in her heart for him.</p>

<p>Jane Welsh Carlyle was a capital hand at a
pen portrait; here is what she has to say of
D’Orsay:—</p>

<p>“<i>April 13, 1845.</i>—To-day, oddly enough,
while I was engaged in re-reading Carlyle’s
<cite>Philosophy of Clothes</cite>, Count d’Orsay walked in.
I had not seen him for four or five years. Last
time he was as gay in his colours as a humming-bird—blue
satin cravat, blue velvet waistcoat,
cream-coloured coat, lined with velvet of the same
hue, trousers also of a bright colour, I forget what;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
white French gloves, two glorious breastpins
attached by a chain, and length enough of gold
watch-guard to have hanged himself in. To-day,
in compliment to his five more years, he was all
in black and brown—a black satin cravat, a brown
velvet waistcoat, a brown coat some shades darker
than the waistcoat, lined with velvet of its own
shade, and almost black trousers, one breast-pin,
a large pear-shaped pearl set into a little cup of
diamonds, and only one fold of gold chain round
his neck, tucked together right on the centre of
his spacious breast with one magnificent turquoise.
Well! that man understood his trade; if it be but
that of dandy, nobody can deny that he is a
perfect master of it, that he dresses himself with
consummate skill! A bungler would have made
no allowance for five more years at his time of
life, but he had the fine sense to perceive how
much better his dress of to-day sets off his slightly
enlarged figure and slightly worn complexion, than
the humming-bird colours of five years back would
have done. Poor D’Orsay! he was born to have
been something better than even the king of
dandies. He did not say nearly so many clever
things this time as on the last occasion. His wit,
I suppose, is of the sort that belongs more to
animal spirits than to real genius, and his animal
spirits seem to have fallen many degrees. The
only thing that fell from him to-day worth remembering
was his account of a mask he had
seen of Charles Fox, ‘all punched and flattened
as if he had slept in a book.’</p>

<p>“Lord Jeffrey came, unexpected, while the
Count was here. What a difference! the prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of critics and the prince of dandies. How washed
out the beautiful dandiacal face looked beside
that little clever old man’s! The large blue
dandiacal eyes, you would have said, had never
contemplated anything more interesting than the
reflection of the handsome personage they pertained
to in a looking-glass; while the dark
penetrating ones of the other had been taking
note of most things in God’s universe, even seeing
a good way into millstones.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXV">XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">SUNSET</span></h2>

<p>Sunset of the glories of Gore House came in the
year 1849, a cold, bitter sunset, presaging a stormy
morrow. Lady Blessington was nearly sixty years
old, well-preserved indeed, but Time’s footsteps
are crow’s-feet. D’Orsay was nearing fifty.
Darby and Joan; only the former at fifty is more
than ten years younger than the latter at sixty.</p>

<p>Behind all the gaiety of Gore House there had
long been a dark background, ever growing more
sinister. Without the harassment of any cares it
would have been difficult for a woman of Lady
Blessington’s age to maintain a sovereignty which
depended almost entirely upon her beauty.
Troubles met her at every turn, and the last few
years at Gore House must have been to her years
of torment and despair. She heard her doom
approaching with sure foot, and knew that she
was unable to stay the advance.</p>

<p>Her jointure of £2000 was entirely inadequate
to maintain the expenses of either Seamore Place
or Gore House, to the exchequers of which
D’Orsay cannot have contributed; any capital that
came into his hands was rapidly dispersed by them
among hungry debtors, and his income of £500
was probably hypothecated in the same way. It
was essential for her, therefore, to add to her
revenue, for the reduction of expenditure does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
seem to have occurred to this luxury-loving soul.
She does indeed seem to have been careful to see
that she obtained her money’s worth, and kept a
tight hand on the household expenses and accounts.
One habit of hers was to keep a “book of dinners,”
noting down the names of the guests at each
entertainment.</p>

<p>When no other way of securing an income
suggests itself to the needy or hard-up, they invariably
take up their pens and write. Lady
Blessington, if it had not been for her beauty and
notoriety, could scarcely have earned a livelihood
as a hack writer for the lesser journals, but her
name gave to her writings a market value which
their intrinsic merit did not. Her <cite>Conversations
with Byron</cite> have already been mentioned, and
sufficiently dealt with; she also wrote books of
travel, novels, verses, edited such periodicals as
<cite>The Keepsake</cite> and <cite>The Book of Beauty</cite>, to which
the eminent authors who fluttered round her at
Gore House contributed, and in the end when
these enterprises were failing became a contributor
to the <cite>Daily News</cite> of “exclusive intelligence,”
that is to say of “any sort of intelligence
she might like to communicate, of the sayings,
doings, memoirs or movements in the fashionable
world,” for which she received payment at the
rate of £400 a year; Dickens and Forster were
her editors.</p>

<p>The death in 1848 of Heath, the publisher, in
insolvency brought a loss to Lady Blessington of
about £700. Her earnings have been placed at
a thousand a year, but William Jerdan in his
<cite>Autobiography</cite> declares them to have been much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
higher. “I have known her to enjoy from her pen
an amount somewhere midway between £2000
and £3000 per annum, and her title, as well as
talents, had considerable influence in ‘ruling high
prices’ as they say in Mark Lane and other
markets. To this, also, her well-arranged parties
with a publisher now and then, to meet folks of
a style unusual to men in business, contributed
their attractions; and the same society was in
reality of solid value towards the production of
such publications as the Annuals, the contents of
which were provided by the editor almost entirely
from the pens of private friends.”</p>

<p>In 1833 by a robbery of jewellery and plate
at Seamore Place, Lady Blessington lost something
like £1000.</p>

<p>These losses, the continual strain of working
to obtain the funds necessary for her luxurious
mode of life and the difficulties in which D’Orsay
was involved told heavily upon her health and
spirits. As she herself writes in her commonplace
book:—</p>

<p>“Great trials demand great courage, and all
our energy is called up to enable us to bear them.
But it is the minor cares of life that wear out the
body, because, singly, and in detail, they do not
appear sufficiently important to engage us to rally
our force and spirits to support them.… Many
minds that have withstood the most severe trials,
have been broken down by a succession of ignoble
cares;” and there is a touch of sorrowful bitterness
in this: “Friends are the thermometers by which
we may judge the temperature of our fortunes.”</p>

<p>Not that she was ill-served by her friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rather the contrary; few women have had so many
or so faithful.</p>

<p>The following letter paints the situation better
than can any words of ours; it was written to
Lady Blessington in or about 1848:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest Friend</span>,—You do not do me
more than justice in the belief that I most fully sympathise
with all your troubles, and I shall be only
too happy if my advice can in any way assist you.</p>

<p>“First. As to your jointure, nothing in law
is so indisputable—as that a widow’s jointure takes
precedence of every other claim on an estate.
The very first money the agent or steward receives
from the property should go to the discharge of
this claim. No subsequent mortgages, annuities,
encumbrances, law-suits, expenses of management,
etc., can be permitted to interfere with the payment
of jointure; and as, whatever the distress of the
tenants, or the embarrassments of the estate, it is
clear that some rents must have come in half-yearly;
so, on those rents you have an indisputable
right; and, I think, on consulting your lawyer, he
will put you in a way, either by a memorial to
Chancery, or otherwise, to secure in future the
regular payment of this life-charge. Indeed, as
property charged with a jointure, although the
rents are not paid for months after the proper
dates, the jointure must be paid on the regular
days, and if not, the proprietor would become
liable to immediate litigation. I am here presuming
that you but ask for the jointure, due quarterly,
or half-yearly, and not in advance, which, if the
affairs are in Chancery, it would be illegal to grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Secondly. With respect to the diamonds,
would it be possible or expedient, to select a
certain portion (say half), which you least value
on their own account; and if a jeweller himself
falls too short in his offer, to get him to sell them
on commission? You must remember, that every
year, by paying interest on them,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> you are losing
money on them, so that in a few years you may
thus lose more than by taking at once less than
their true value. There are diamond merchants,
who, I believe, give more for those articles than
jewellers, and if you know Anthony Rothschild,
and would not object to speak to him, he might
help you.…</p>

<p>“I know well how, to those accustomed to
punctual payments, and with a horror of debt,
pecuniary embarrassments prey upon the mind, but
I think they may be borne, not only with ease, but
some degree of complacency, when connected
with such generous devotions and affectionate
services as those which must console you amidst
all your cares. In emptying your purse you have
at least filled your heart with consolations, which
will long outlast what I trust will be but the troubles
of a season.”</p>

</div>

<p>The last sentences refer to the generous
charity which was one of Lady Blessington’s
saving graces: parents, brothers, sisters, friends,
lover, all benefited by her aid. Two very pleasing
letters from Mrs S. C. Hall may be quoted on
this and other points:—</p>

<p>“I have never had occasion to appeal to Lady
Blessington for aid for any kind or charitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
purpose, that she did not <em>at once</em>, with a grace
peculiarly her own, come forward cheerfully and
‘help’ to the extent of her power.”</p>

<p>And:—</p>

<p>“When Lady Blessington left London, she
did not forget the necessities of several of her
poor dependants, who received regular aid from
her after her arrival, and while she resided in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> She found time, despite her literary
labours, her anxieties and the claims which she
permitted society to make upon her time, not only
to do acts of kindness now and then for those
in whom she felt an interest, but to give what
seemed perpetual thought to their well-doing:
and she never missed an opportunity of doing a
gracious act or saying a gracious word.…</p>

<p>“I have no means of knowing whether what
the world said of this beautiful woman was true or
false, but I am sure God intended her to be good,
and there was a deep-seated good intent in whatever
she did that came under my observation.</p>

<p>“Her sympathies were quick and cordial, and
independent of worldiness; her taste in art and
literature womanly and refined; I say ‘womanly,’
because she had a perfectly feminine appreciation
of whatever was delicate and beautiful.…
Her manners were singularly simple and graceful;
it was to me an intense delight to look at beauty,
which though I never saw in its full bloom, was
charming in its autumn time; and the Irish
accent, and soft, sweet, Irish laugh, used to make
my heart beat with the pleasures of memory.…
Her conversation was not witty nor wise, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
was in good tune and good taste, mingled with a
great deal of humour, which escaped everything
bordering on vulgarity. It was surprising how a
tale of distress or a touching anecdote would at
once suffuse her clear intelligent eyes with tears,
and her beautiful mouth would break into smiles
and dimples at even the echo of wit or jest.”</p>

<p>This is singularly interesting as the evidence
of a woman, one of the few who were intimate
with Lady Blessington. Of an Irish woman too,
who could perceive and appreciate the womanly
side of Lady Blessington’s simple nature.
Simple, yes; she was just a simple, emotional,
luxury-loving, laughter-loving sympathetic Irish
woman, who under favourable circumstances
might have been a true and adorable wife and
helpmate; who under the circumstances that did
rule her life, became—Lady Blessington.</p>

<p>Such first-hand testimony as that of Mrs S. C.
Hall is worth a wilderness of commentary; to it
we will add this from Lady Blessington’s maid,
Anne Cooper:—</p>

<p>“My lady’s spirits were naturally good:
before she was overpowered with difficulties, and
troubles on account of them, she was very
cheerful, droll, and particularly amusing. This
was natural to her. Her general health was
usually good; she often told me she had never
been confined to her bed one whole day in her
life. And her spirits would have continued good,
but that she got so overwhelmed with care and
expenses of all kinds. The calls for her
assistance were from all quarters. Some depended
wholly on her (and had a regular pension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
quarterly paid)—her father and mother, for
many years before they died; the education of
children of friends fell upon her.… Constant
assistance had to be given to others—(to the
family, in particular, of one poor lady, now dead
some years, whom she loved very dearly). She
did a great many charities; for instance, she gave
very largely to poor literary people, poor artists;
something yearly to old servants … and from
some, whom she served, to add to all her other
miseries, she met with shameful ingratitude.</p>

<p>“Labouring night and day at literary work,
all her anxiety was to be clear of debt. She was
latterly constantly trying to curtail all her
expenses in her own establishment, and constantly
toiling to get money. Worried and harassed at
not being able to pay bills when they were sent
in; at seeing large expenses still going on, and
knowing the want of means to meet them, she
got no sleep at night. She long wished to give
up Gore House, to have a sale of her furniture,
and to pay off her debts. She wished this for
two years before she left England; but when the
famine in Ireland rendered the payment of her
jointure irregular, and every succeeding year
more and more so, her difficulties increased, and,
at last, Howell &amp; James put an execution in
the house.… Poor soul! her heart was too
large for her means.”</p>

<p>Still Lady Blessington fought on, and faced
the footlights without outward faltering; she
played her part in the comedy and received the
applause of her friends, few of whom realised that
the comedy was a tragedy. “Passion! Possession!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Indifference!” she writes, “what a history
is comprised in these three words! What hopes
and fears succeeded by a felicity as brief as intoxicating—followed
in its turn by the old consequence
of possession—indifference! What
burning tears, what bitter pangs, rending the very
heartstrings—what sleepless nights and watchful
days form part of this everyday story of life,
whose termination leaves the actors to search
again for new illusions to finish like the last.”
But what new illusions can be looked for by a
tried, sad woman of sixty?</p>

<p>D’Orsay was locked up in Gore House during
these last two years of sunset for six days out of
each seven; debt hung like a millstone round
his neck also. These two, who had sailed over
happy seas with favourable winds, were now together
drifting on the rocks.</p>

<p>One day in April a sheriff’s officer, effectually
disguised, managed to enter the house, and then
the end of this second act of our play came rapidly.
Lady Blessington informed of the mishap, realising
that once it was known that an execution was
laid upon her property there would no more be
any safety for the Count’s person, sent to D’Orsay’s
room to warn him of his danger.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed D’Orsay, unable or unwilling
to believe that the hour for flight had
at last come upon him; and again and again
“Bah!” Not until Lady Blessington herself added
her personal persuasion did he grasp the situation.</p>

<p>De Contades gives a somewhat different
account. Just before the dinner hour, a pastry-cook’s
boy presented himself at Gore House with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a dish, sent in, so he said, by the confectioner.
Having left this in the kitchen, he deliberately
walked upstairs to the Count’s dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Well, who’s that?” asked D’Orsay.</p>

<p>It was a sheriff’s officer!</p>

<p>“Really!” exclaimed D’Orsay, and demanded
that he should be permitted to complete the tying
of his tie—<i lang="fr">salon</i> or prison—his tie must be perfect.</p>

<p>“But, Count—”</p>

<p>“Bah, bah! All in good time.”</p>

<p>The officer was quite interested in the tying
of that tie; few men had been so honoured as to
be allowed to see how D’Orsay tied his tie—and,
lo! by the time the tie <em>was</em> tied, the sun had sunk
to rest and D’Orsay was free till sunrise!</p>

<p>“John,” said D’Orsay, calmly walking off to
the drawing-room, “kick this chap out of the
door.”</p>

<p>The which was executed and the writ was not.</p>

<p>In the grey of the morning, however, D’Orsay,
taking every precaution against capture on the
way, set out for Paris with a valet, a valise,
and an umbrella. The words of a great man at
any moment of crisis in his affairs are worth
recording; one of D’Orsay’s last remarks in
London was: “Well, at least, if I have nothing
else, I will have the best umbrella!”</p>

<p>That was the bravado of a brave man. What
really was in his mind? What were Napoleon’s
thoughts as he turned his back upon Moscow?
What were D’Orsay’s as he fled that morning,
conquered, from the town he had captured and
enslaved so long?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE END OF GORE HOUSE</span></h2>

<p>Before following D’Orsay to Paris, we will witness
the end of the Blessington <i lang="fr">régime</i> at Gore House.
The harassed lady’s creditors swarmed round her;
she had given bills and bonds in anticipation of
her jointure for something like £1500; Howell
&amp; James’ account seems to have amounted to
£4000!! Money-lenders, bill-discounters, tax-collectors,
tradesmen of every kind, all rushed in
to see what could be saved. In the event it was
found impossible to avoid a sale of her goods and
effects.</p>

<p>On April 9th, 1849, Lady Blessington writes
to Forster from Gore House:</p>

<p>“As I purpose leaving England in a few days,
it will pain me very much to depart without
personally wishing you farewell; and though I
am in all the fever of packing up, I will make
time to receive a visit from you, if you can call any
day this week between eleven o’clock in the fore-noon,
or after nine in the evening. Count d’Orsay
was called to Paris so suddenly, that he had not
time to take leave of any of his friends, but he
charged me to say a thousand kind things to you.”</p>

<p>The following from Disraeli reached her in
Paris:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>25th April 1849.</i></p>

<p>“We returned to town on the 16th, and a few
days after, I called at Gore House, but you were
gone. It was a pang; for though absorbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
duties of my life have prevented me of late from
passing as much time under that roof as it was
once my happiness and good fortune through your
kindness to do; you are well assured, that my
heart never changed for an instant to its inmates
and that I invariably entertained for them the
same interest and affection.</p>

<p>“Had I been aware of your intentions, I
would have come up to town earlier, and specially
to have said ‘Adieu!’ mournful as that is.</p>

<p>“I thought I should never pay another visit
to Paris, but I have now an object in doing so.
All the world here will miss you very much, and
the charm with which you invested existence;
but for your own happiness, I am persuaded you
have acted wisely. Every now and then, in this
life, we require a great change; it wonderfully
revives the sense of existence. I envy you; pray,
if possible, let me sometimes hear from you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thackeray writes to Mrs Brookfield:—</p>

<p>“I have just come away from a dismal sight;
Gore House full of snobs looking at the furniture.
Foul Jews; odious bombazine women, who drove
up in mysterious flys which they had hired, the
wretches, to be fined (? fine), so as to come in
state to a fashionable lounge; brutes keeping
their hats on in the kind old drawing-room—I
longed to knock some of them off, and say, ‘Sir,
be civil in a lady’s room.…’ There was one of
the servants there, not a powdered one, but a
butler, a <em>whatd’youcallit</em>. My heart melted
towards him and I gave him a pound. Ah! it
was a strange, sad picture of <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The catalogue of the sale gives an idea of the
“household gods”:—</p>

<p>“Costly and elegant effects: comprising all
the magnificent furniture, rare porcelain, sculpture
in marble, bronzes, and an assemblage of objects
of art and decoration; a casket of valuable
jewellery and <i lang="fr">bijouterie</i>, services of chased silver
and silver-gilt plate, a superbly-fitted silver dressing-case;
collection of ancient and modern pictures,
including many portraits of distinguished persons,
valuable original drawings, and fine engravings,
framed and in portfolios; the extensive and interesting
library of books, comprising upwards of
5000 volumes, expensive table services of china and
rich cut glass, and an infinity of useful and valuable
articles. All the property of the Right Hon. the
Countess of Blessington, retiring to the Continent.”</p>

<p>So wrote Mr Phillips, “that eminent author
of auctioneering advertisements.”</p>

<p>The sale took place in May, and was attended
by a crowd of fashionables, and the net sum
realised was £11,985, 4s. 0d. Lawrence’s portrait
of Lady Blessington, now in the Wallace Collection,
fetched £336 and was purchased by Lord Hertford,
who also acquired D’Orsay’s portrait of the Duke
of Wellington for £189. Chalon’s portrait of
Lady Blessington was saved from the wreck; it
is now in the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

writes to her:—</p>

<p>Lady Blessington returned to the city where her
husband had died; D’Orsay to serve under another
Napoleon than he to whom he had once aspired
to render duty. Lady Blessington took a suite of
rooms in the Hôtel de la Ville l’Evêque, but
shortly moved into an <i lang="fr">appartement</i> in the Rue du
Cerq, hard by the Champs Elysées, which she
furnished, partly with some of the salvage from
the sale, and where she lived very cosily upon her
jointure.</p>

<p>The following letter is from Henry Bulwer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>May 6, 1849.</i></p>

<p>“I was very glad to get your letter. I never
had a doubt (I judged by myself) that your

he was away, would become so when he was
present.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It would be great ingratitude if Prince

<p>“I think you will take a house in Paris or near
it, and I hope some day there to find you, and to
renew some of the many happy hours I have
spent in your society. I shall attend the sale,
and advise all my friends to do so. From what I
hear, things will probably sell well. I am sure
that Samson will execute any commission for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
when he goes to Paris, and I gave Douro your
message, who returns it.…”</p>

<p>Napoleon as President, however, was a different
man from a mere Prince in Exile, and could
scarcely show himself as intimate in Paris with
Lady Blessington and D’Orsay as he had done in
London. Accompanied by the Misses Power
they dined at the Elysée Palace, and then social
intercourse apparently ceased. That D’Orsay had
in other days been of great assistance to Napoleon,
and that Lady Blessington had been to him a
most kind hostess, there is no denying; they
expected much now in return, but Napoleon could
scarcely in decency give much.</p>

<p>It is narrated that Napoleon said to Lady
Blessington: “Are you going to stay long in
France?”</p>

<p>And that she with more wit than wisdom
replied: “I don’t know. <em>Are you?</em>”</p>

<p>Lady Blessington was warmly welcomed by
many of her old friends, notably by various
members of the family of de Grammont. She
tried to resume in a minor key at Paris the life she
had led at Gore House; but the endeavour failed.</p>

<p>A letter from Lady Blessington’s niece,
Margaret Power, brings us to the closing scene
of this portion of our story:—</p>

<p>“On arriving in Paris, my aunt followed a mode
of life differing considerably from the sedentary one
she had for such a length of time pursued; she rose
earlier, took much exercise, and, in consequence,
lived somewhat higher than was her wont, for she
was habitually a remarkably small eater; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
appeared to agree with her <em>general</em> health, for she
looked well, and was cheerful; but she began to
suffer occasionally (especially in the morning) from
oppression and difficulty of breathing. These
symptoms, slight at first, she carefully concealed
from our knowledge, having always a great objection
to medical treatment; but as they increased
in force and frequency, she was obliged to reveal
them, and medical aid was immediately called in.
Dr Léon Simon pronounced there was <i lang="fr">énergie du
cœur</i>, but that the symptoms in question proceeded
probably from bronchitis—a disease then very
prevalent in Paris—that they were nervous, and
entailed no danger, and as, after the remedies he
prescribed, the attacks diminished perceptibly in
violence, and her general health seemed little
affected by them, he entertained no serious alarm.</p>

<p>“On the 3rd of June, she was removed from
the hotel we had occupied during the seven weeks
we had passed in Paris, and entered the residence
which my poor aunt had devoted so much pains
and attention to the selecting and furnishing of,
and that same day dined <i lang="fr">en famille</i> with the
Duc and Duchesse de Guiche (Count d’Orsay’s
nephew). On that occasion, my aunt seemed
particularly well in health and spirits, and it being
a lovely night, we walked home by moonlight.
As usual, I aided my aunt to undress—she never
allowed her maid to sit up for her—and left her a
little after midnight. She passed, it seems, some
most restless hours (she was habitually a bad
sleeper), and early in the morning, feeling the
commencement of one of the attacks, she called
for assistance, and Dr Simon was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sent for, the symptoms manifesting themselves
with considerable violence, and in the meantime,
the remedies he had ordered—sitting upright,
rubbing the chest and upper stomach with ether, administering
ether, internally, etc.—were all resorted
to without effect; the difficulty of breathing became
so excessive, that the whole of the chest heaved
upwards at each inspiration, which was inhaled with
a loud whooping noise, the face was swollen and
purple, the eyeballs distended, and utterance almost
wholly denied, while the extremities gradually
became cold and livid, in spite of every attempt to
restore the vital heat. By degrees, the violence of
the symptoms abated; she uttered a few words; the
first, ‘The violence is over, I can breathe freer’;
and soon after, ‘<i lang="fr">Quelle heure est-il?</i>’ Thus encouraged,
we deemed the danger past; but, alas!
how bitterly were we deceived; she gradually sank
from that moment, and when Dr Simon, who had
been delayed by another patient, arrived, he saw
that hope was gone; and, indeed, she expired so
easily, so tranquilly, that it was impossible to
perceive the moment when her spirit passed
away.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay was alone.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed that death was caused
by enlargement of the heart. The body was
embalmed and lay in the vaults of the Madeleine
until the monument at Chambourcy, where was
the seat of the de Grammonts, a few miles from
St Germain-en-Laye, was ready to receive it.
The mausoleum, designed by D’Orsay, stands
upon a slight eminence; a railing of bronze encloses
a pyramid of granite rising from a square platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of black stone. Entering the burial chamber,
against the opposite wall is a copy in bronze of
Michael Angelo’s crucified Christ. On either side
the chamber stands a sarcophagus—in that to the
left lies Lady Blessington. “It stands,” writes
Miss Power, “on a hillside, just above the village
cemetery, and overlooks a view of exquisite beauty
and immense extent, taking in the Seine winding
through the fertile valley and the forest of St
Germain; plains, villages and far distant hills, and
at the back and side it is sheltered by chestnut
trees of large size and great age; a more
picturesque spot it is difficult to imagine.” The
ivy growing over the green turf was sent from
Ireland by Bernal Osborne.</p>

<p>On the wall above the tomb of Lady Blessington
are two epitaphs, one in Latin by Landor; the
other by Barry Cornwall, which runs as follows:—</p>

<p class="center">IN HER LIFETIME<br />
SHE WAS LOVED AND ADMIRED,<br />

<p>So far truth, and it is not to be expected of an
epitaph that it should tell the whole truth.</p>

<p>In April 1849, D’Orsay writes to Dr Quin from
Paris:—</p>

<div class="blockquote" lang="fr">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">38 Rue de la Ville l’Eveque.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon bon Quin</span>,—J’ai eu un départ imprévu
heureusement, que je suis <em>safe</em> de ce côté. Il a fallu
que je me décide de partir à 3 hrs de la nuit pour ne
pas manquer le Dimanche. Ces dames vous
racontent qu’une de mes prèmieres pensées ici ont
été pour vous. Vous le voyez par ce peu de mots—aimez
moi toujours de loin, car je vous aimais
bien de près.—Votre meilleur ami,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The death of Lady Blessington was a blow to
him from which he never really recovered. Writing
to Madden from Chambourcy on 12th July,
Miss Power says:—</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay would himself have answered
your letter, but had not the nerve or the heart to
do so; although the subject occupies his mind
night and day, he cannot speak of it but to those
who have been his fellow-sufferers. It is like an
image ever floating before his eyes, which he has
got, as it were, used to look upon, but which he
cannot yet bear to grasp and feel that it is real.
Much as she was to us, we cannot but feel that to
him she was all; the centre of his existence, round
which his recollections, thoughts, hopes and plans
turned, and just at the moment she was about to
commence a new mode of life, one that promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a rest from the occupation and anxieties that had
for some years fallen to her share, death deprived
us of her.”</p>

<p>The first visit that he paid to her tomb had a
heart-breaking effect upon him; at one moment
he would be stunned, at another driven to frenzy
by his grief. What thoughts of past times must
have assailed him: of his first meeting with her in
London so many years ago; of the long days and
nights of delight in Italy; of his marriage, perchance;
of Seamore Place, of Gore House; of
hours of merriment and of sorrow; of her tried
faithfulness to him; of his occasional faithlessness.
That his love for her survived even the advance
of years we cannot doubt; but the love of man is
different far from the love of woman.</p>

<p>In a letter, already partly quoted, to Lane,
D’Orsay says, writing early in 1850:—</p>

<p>“Poor Miss Power is very much affected.
There is no consolation to offer. The only one
that I can imagine, is to think continually of the
person lost, and to make oneself more miserable
by thinking. It is, morally speaking, an homœopathic
treatment, and the only one which can give
some relief. You cannot form an idea of the
<i lang="fr">soulagement</i> that I found, in occupying myself in
the country (at Chambourcy) in building the monument
which I have erected to dear Lady Blessington’s
memory. I made it so solid and so fine,
that I felt all the time that death was the reality
and life only the dream of all around me. When
I hear anyone making projects for the future, I
laugh, feeling as I do now, that we may to-morrow,
without five minutes’ notice, have to follow those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
we regret. I am prepared for that, with a satisfactory
resignation.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay wrote to Forster on April 23rd,
1850:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Miss Power has told you how much I love
you, and how often we talk about you. The fact
is, I am full of reminiscences, and they are such a
medley of displeasure and pleasure that I hesitate
to write even to those who are most likely to
understand me. Just think that I have not even
yet written to Edward Bulwer. You’ll understand,
I’m sure. To-day I dined with Lamartine
and Victor Hugo at Girardin’s.…</p>

<p>“Do not let Fonblanque think I have forgotten
him? Give a thousand friendly wishes
from me to Dickens and his wife, and embrace
my godson for me. I count also on your speaking
kindly of me to Macready and his wife, and
to the good Maclise. It seems to me almost as
if I had only gone away to-day, my recollections
are so vivid; it is truly a daguerreotype of the
heart that nothing can efface. I adore old
England, and long to return there. Never did
man so suffer as I have done for my loss.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>“I wonder at those religious people who hold
religion so high that they quickly find consolation.
They do not understand, the idiots, that there is
a great, a greater faith in a true sorrow which
does not heal.</p>

<p>“Adieu, <i lang="fr">mon brave ami</i>, count always on my
affection,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>He found comfort in the companionship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Lady Blessington’s two nieces, Margaret and
Ellen. To a certain extent he avoided mixing
in society, but we hear of him now and again.</p>

<p>In 1850 he rented a large studio and some
smaller rooms in the house of Theodore Gudin,
the marine painter, to which he conveyed all his
belongings, and where he settled down to work
and sedate entertaining. Here Thackeray visited
him:—</p>

<p>“To-day I went to see D’Orsay, who has made
a bust of Lamartine,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who … is mad with
vanity. He has written some verses on his bust,
and asks: ‘Who is this? Is it a warrior? Is it
a hero? Is it a priest? Is it a sage? Is it a
tribune of the people? Is it an Adonis?’ meaning
that he is all these things,—verses so fatuous
and crazy I never saw. Well, D’Orsay says they
are the finest verses that ever were written, and
imparts to me a translation which Miss Power
has made of them; and D’Orsay believes in his
mad rubbish of a statue, which he didn’t make;
believes in it in the mad way that madmen do,—that
it is divine, and that he made it; only as you
look in his eyes, you see that he doesn’t quite
believe, and when pressed hesitates, and turns
away with a howl of rage. D’Orsay has fitted
himself up a charming <i lang="fr">atelier</i>, with arms and
trophies, pictures and looking-glasses, the tomb
of Blessington, the sword and star of Napoleon,
and a crucifix over his bed; and here he dwells
without any doubts or remorses, admiring himself
in the most horrible pictures which he has painted,
and the statues which he gets done for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Lamington gives a curious account of a
visit:—</p>

<p>I “found his room all hung with black curtains,
the bed and window-curtains were the same; all
the souvenirs of one so dear were collected around
him.”</p>

<p>Of the friends that rallied around him, Madden
names as among the most faithful the ex-King
Jérôme and his son, Prince Napoleon, and Emile
de Girardin. Of the man of the bust, D’Orsay
writes, in April 1850: “Lamartine me disait hier:
‘Plus je vois de représentants du peuple, plus
j’aime mes chiens.’”</p>

<p>Early in February 1851 we find Dickens in
Paris, stopping at the Hôtel Wagram; D’Orsay
dined with him on the 11th and Dickens went
in return to the <i lang="fr">atelier</i> the next day. “He was
very happy with us,” he writes, “and is much
improved both in spirits and looks.”</p>

<p>In May 1850 Abraham Hayward was in Paris,
and dined at Philippe’s with a highly-distinguished
company, including Brougham, Alexandre Dumas,
Lord Dufferin, the Hon. W. Stuart, a Mr Dundas
of Carron, Hayward himself and D’Orsay. Lord
Dufferin, who, however, gives 1849 as the date,
describes this dinner as “noisy but amusing.”
The object of the dinner was the bringing together
of Brougham and Dumas:—“Brougham
was punctual to the hour, and they were formally
introduced by Count d’Orsay, who, observing some
slight symptoms of stiffness, exclaimed: ‘<i lang="fr">Comment,
diable, vous, les deux grands hommes, embrassez-vous
donc, embrassez-vous.</i>’ They fraternised accordingly
<i lang="fr">à la française</i>, Brougham looking very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
much during the operation as if he were in the
grip of a bear, though nobody could look more
cordial and satisfied than Dumas. The dinner
was excellent. Some first rate <i lang="fr">Clos de Vougeot</i>,
of which Dumas had an accurate foreknowledge,
sustained the hilarity of the company; the conversation
was varied and animated; each of the
distinguished guests took his fair share, and no
more than his fair share; and it was bordering on
midnight when the party separated.”</p>

<p>The price of the dinner was twenty francs a
head, not including the wine, and D’Orsay and
Hayward were jointly responsible for the <i lang="fr">menu</i>.
“The most successful dishes were the <i lang="fr">bisque</i>, the
<i lang="fr">fritures Italiennes</i>, and the <i lang="fr">gigot à la Bretonne</i>,”
so says Hayward.</p>

<p>In his latest days he still retained a keen zest
for the good things of the table, as is shown by this
letter of his to Hayward:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>1st May 1852</i>.</p>

<p>“I must confess with regret that the culinary
art has sadly fallen off in Paris; and I do not very
clearly see how it is to recover, as there are at
present no great establishments where the school
can be kept up.</p>

<p>“You must have remarked, when you were
here, that at all the first-class <i lang="fr">restaurants</i> you had
nearly the same dinner; they may, however, be
divided into three categories. Undoubtedly, the
best for a great dinner and good wine are the
Frères Provençaux (Palais Royal); Philippe (Rue
Mont Orgueil), and the Café de Paris; the latter
is not always to be counted upon, but is excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
when they give you a <i lang="fr">soigné</i> dinner. In the
second class are Véry (Palais Royal), Vefour (Café
Anglais), and Champeaux (Place de la Bourse),
where you can have a most <em>conscientious</em> dinner,
good without pretension; the situation is central,
in a beautiful garden, and you must ask for a
<i lang="fr">bifstek à la Châteaubriand</i>. At the head of the
third class we must place Bonvallet, on the Boulevard
du Temple, near all the little theatres;
Defieux, chiefly remarkable for corporation and
assembly dinners.… The two best places for
suppers are the Maison d’Or and the Café
Anglais; and for breakfasts, Tortoni’s, and the
Café d’Orsay on the Quai d’Orsay. In the vicinity
of Paris, the best <i lang="fr">restaurant</i> is the Pavilion Henri
Quatre, at St Germains, kept by the old cook of
the Duchesse de Berri. At none of these places
could you find dinners now such as were produced
by Ude; by Soyer, formerly with Lord Chesterfield;
by Rotival, with Lord Wilton; or by
Perron, with Lord Londonderry.… You are
now <i lang="fr">au fait</i> of the pretended French gastronomy.
It has emigrated to England, and has no wish to
return. We do not absolutely die of hunger here,
and that is all that can be said.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few other friends were faithful. There was
Eugene Sue, a much read man in his day, but his
name drags on a precarious existence now as the
author of <cite>The Mysteries of Paris</cite> and <cite>The Wandering
Jew</cite>. Probably his chief claim to immortality
will be found to be his friendship with D’Orsay,
who indeed inspired him with the central figure
of “Le Viscomte de Letocère, ou L’Art de
Plaire.” He was quite a dandy in his way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
though of course not comparable in degree
with D’Orsay, and, strange combination, was a bit
of a Communist. He gave vent to the true saying
that “No one had any right to superfluity”—not
even excepting D’Orsay?—“while any one
was in want of necessaries.” Yet this is a description
of his manner of “doing himself:”—</p>

<p>“It is impossible to convey an idea of this
luxury, of the sumptuousness of those caprices, of
those whims of all kinds: here a dining-room,
where the sideboards display plate, porcelain, and
crystal, with pictures and flowers, to add to the
pleasures of the table all the pleasures of the
eyes; there an inner gallery, where pictures,
statuettes, drawings, and engravings, reproduce
subjects the most calculated to excite the imagination.
Here is a library full of antiques, whose
bookcases contain works bound with unheard-of
luxury, where objects of art are multiplied with
an absence of calculated affectation, which appears
as if wishing to say they came there naturally.
Daylight, shaded by the painted glass windows,
and curtains of the richest stuff, gives to this place
an air of mystery, invites to silence and to study,
and produces those eccentric inspirations which
M. Sue gives to the public. A desk, richly
carved, receives sundry manuscripts of the
romance-writer, the numerous <i lang="fr">homages</i> sent to
Monsieur, as the valet expresses himself, from all
the corners of the globe.… Everywhere may
be seen gold, silver, silk, velvet, and soft carpets.…
A vast drawing-room, furnished and decorated
with all imaginable care, exactly reproduces
that of one of the heroines of romance of Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Eugene Sue, and there have been carved on the
woodwork of a Gothic mantelpiece medallions
representing the Magdalen falling at the feet of
our Saviour, who tells her that her sins will be
forgiven her, because her love has been strong.…
A small gallery, lined with odoriferous
plants, leads to a circular walk, which surrounds
a garden cultivated in the most expensive manner,
and there is a fine piece of water, with numerous
swans in it. The walk is a <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i> of comfort,
for it is alike protected from the wind and the
rain, being covered with a dome. It is enclosed
with balustrades, covered with creeping plants of
the choicest nature. It is a sort of terrestrial
paradise … and beyond it is a park, admirably
laid out with kiosques, rustic cottages, elegant
bridges, and a preserve for pheasants, which
secures myriads of birds for the shooting excursions
of the illustrious Communist, whose
keepers exercise a severe look-out to prevent any
person from touching the game.” A paradise
almost worthy of being the home of D’Orsay!</p>

<p>Sue rightly appreciated D’Orsay, and wrote
thus of him to Lady Blessington: “Je quitte
Alfred avec une vraie tristesse; plus je le connais,
plus j’apprecie ce bon, ce vaillant cœur, si chaud,
si génereux pour ceux qu’il aime.”</p>

<p>Arsène Houssaye had seen D’Orsay at a dinner
at Lamartine’s, but had not spoken with him.
Houssaye wrote him down as a very fascinating
man, “with a smiling air which comes from and
speaks to the heart.” Rachel came into Houssaye’s
office to meet him.</p>

<p>“It’s natural I should find you here,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“for it was to see you I came to see Arsène
Houssaye. You play <cite>Phèdre</cite> to-night; I should
count it great luck to be there, but there’s not a
single seat to be got either in the stalls or the
balcony.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Manager Houssaye, “but there’s
my own box, which I offer you with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Good! I accept it as an act of friendship, for it’s
the best in the house. I’ll offer it to the Duchesse
de Grammont, who will come with Guiche.”</p>

<p>The evening was a great success for all concerned,
and Rachel gracefully said—“Comment
ne jouerais-je pas bien quand je vois dans l’avant-scène
deux Hippolytes?”</p>

<p>D’Orsay and Houssaye became quite good
friends, and the latter frequently visited the Count
in his studio, which he describes as “being at once
the <i lang="fr">salon</i>, studio, work-room, smoking-room, fitted
with divans, couches and hammocks.” D’Orsay
made a small medallion portrait of his visitor, and
chatted much about Byron, from whom he showed
a curious letter in which the poet says: “If I
started life again, I would live unknown in Paris;
I would not write a word, not even to women;
but one cannot start life afresh, which is lucky!”</p>

<p>A very different view, however, is that which
now follows:—</p>

<p>Count Horace de Viel Castel notes: “The
journals say that Count d’Orsay has received the
commission for a marble statue of Prince Jérôme
to be placed at Versailles. So much the worse
for Versailles.</p>

<p>“The Count is an old ‘lion,’ whom nobody
now knows or receives. He has lived with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
mother-in-law, Lady Blessington, the blue-stocking
of the <em>keepsakes</em>, and with everyone
but his wife, Lady Henrietta d’Orsay, who was
the mistress of the Duke d’Orleans, of Antoine
de Noailles, and a host of lesser stars.</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay for twenty years lived on the
aristocracy and the tradespeople of London.
Steeped in debt, he has now turned artist, backed
by a following of nonentities.… Every year he
disfigures some contemporaneous celebrity either
in marble or plaster; last time it was Lamartine.</p>

<p>“D’Orsay has still great pretensions to elegance,
and dresses like no one else, with a display of
embroidered linen, satin, gold chains, and hair all
disordered.”</p>

<p>Accusations of a more serious character also
he brings against him, even that he tried to
persuade Jérôme Bonaparte that he was his son,
so that he might receive some place or promotion.</p>

<p>Then on December 2nd, 1851, came the
thunderclap of the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, when the Prince
who had become a President created himself an
Emperor, and at the same time appears to have
put an end to his friendship toward D’Orsay.
Shortly after the event, D’Orsay was dining with
a large company, and naturally the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>
came up for discussion and comment. D’Orsay
was quite outspoken in his condemnation, and
said: “It is the greatest political swindle that ever
has been practised in the world!” Which remark
very naturally created considerable dismay in the
circle; it is not wise to express too freely adverse
opinions of emperors—while they are alive.</p>

<p>In Abraham Hayward’s <cite>Correspondence</cite>, considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
light is thrown upon D’Orsay’s opinions
of Napoleon and the political situation in Paris.
On 17th January 1850, he writes from 38 Rue de
la Ville l’Evêque:—</p>

<div class="blockquote" lang="fr">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Cher Hayward</span>,—J’aurois dû vous
répondre plus tôt, pour vous remercier de l’article
que vous m’avez envoyé. J’attendois d’avoir vu
Louis Napoléon. Nous voici de retour à Paris,
établi pour l’Hiver qui est des plus <em>rudes</em>. Les
affaires ici vont mal; l’amour propre en souffrance
fait tous les grands révolutionnaires en France,
il n’y a pas dix hommes de bonne foi dans ce beau
pays; les gens opposent dans la Chambre les lois
qu’ils avait eux-mêmes proposées anciennement.
Thiers et Berryer, bavards de profession, sont si
versés d’être mis de côté, qu’ils combinent une
conjuration de Catalina. Les élections de Paris
montreront définitivement de quel côté est le
vent; en attendant, dans le midi, le gouvernement
est obligé de donner son appui à des candidats
légitimistes, plutôt que de voir des extrêmes
rouges remporter la victoire, c’est bien tomber de
Charybdis dans Scylla. Napoléon a le plus grand
désir <i lang="en">to run straight</i>, mais les <em>crossins</em> et <em lang="em">jostlings</em>
cherchent à l’empêcher, vous devez vous en
apercevoir.… Rappelez-moi au bon souvenir
de mes amis d’Angleterre, j’y suis souvent en
pensée, et malgré que cela soit toujours avec un
grand sentiment de tristesse je préfère cela aux
gaietés de Paris. Votre très dévoué,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">D’Orsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then on the 5th, possibly the 6th, of December
1851, D’Orsay sends over to Hayward for publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
in the English Press, the letter published
in Paris on the 4th by Jérôme, which was scarcely
calculated to please nephew Louis. Two lines in
D’Orsay’s covering note are striking:—“I always
think of dear old England, that one must like
every day more from what we see everywhere else.”</p>

<p>On 2nd January, of the year following, D’Orsay
writes a long and interesting letter to Hayward,
in which he says emphatically that he was and is
strongly opposed to the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, and that on
account of it Louis Napoleon had sunk in his
estimation, as he had believed him to be a man as
good as his word. He held that Napoleon would
have “arrived” without employing illegitimate
means, and that Republicanism was an almost
negligible quantity. After discussing the standing
of various leaders and parties, he continues:—</p>

<p>“Vous voyez que je suis juste et impartial,
quoique je suis reconnu, depuis 40 années, d’être le
plus grand et le plus sincère Napoléonien qui existe.”
And: “Vous ne pouvez concevoir à quel point les
gens ici sont courtisans et plats valets; vanité et succès
sont les deux mots d’ordres.… Tout marche
à l’Empire.” In conclusion: “Ah! if I were rich,
I would soon be in London. Here I am an exile.”</p>

<p>A few days later he writes again to much the
same purport, and says: “J’ai l’air d’être dans une
opposition, parce que je n’approuve pas la route
que Louis a pris pour arriver où il en est maintenant.”
Who can doubt that Louis Napoleon
blundered in not asking for and accepting D’Orsay’s
advice? But then it was natural that he should
not have done so; the little seldom care to accept
the aid of the great.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXIX">XXIX<br />
<span class="smaller">DEATH</span></h2>

<p>In the early part of 1852 a trouble of the spine
became apparent, causing poor D’Orsay much pain
and sickness, which he bore with admirable and
uncomplaining patience. In July the doctors
ordered him to Dieppe, whither he went accompanied
by the faithful Misses Power; but it was
too late; death was evidently at hand. At the
end of the month he returned to Paris, to die.</p>

<p>On 2nd August, the Archbishop of Paris
visited him, and on parting, embraced him, saying:
“J’ai pour vous plus que de l’amitié, j’ai de
l’affection.” The next day he received the last
consolations of the Church at the hands of the curé
of Chambourcy.</p>

<p>Madden had visited him during his last weeks,
and has left a strange account of an interview with
him, which must be quoted verbatim:—</p>

<p>“The wreck only of the <i lang="fr">beau</i> D’Orsay was
there.</p>

<p>“He was able to sit up and walk, though with
difficulty and evidently with pain, about his room,
which was at once his studio, reception room, and
sleeping apartment. He burst out crying when I
entered the room, and continued for a length of
time so much affected that he could hardly speak
to me. Gradually he became composed, and
talked about Lady Blessington’s death, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
time with tears pouring down his pale wan face,
for even then his features were death-stricken.</p>

<p>“He said with marked emphasis: ‘<em>In losing
her I lost everything in this world—she was to me
a mother! a dear, dear mother!</em> a true <em>loving
mother to me!</em>’ While he uttered these words he
sobbed and cried like a child. And referring
to them, he again said: ‘<em>You understand</em> me,
Madden.’”</p>

<p>Madden believed D’Orsay to have been speaking
in all sincerity. What are we to believe?
There is something almost terrible in this scene of
the dying dandy, broken down in body and spirits,
making a gallant effort to clear the name he had
for years besmirched. But the statements of the
dying must not be allowed to weigh against the
deeds of the living. And would the dead lady
have been pleased?</p>

<p>Madden continues:—</p>

<p>“I said, among the many objects which caught
my attention in the room, I was very glad to see
a crucifix placed over the head of his bed; men
living in the world as he had done, were so much
in the habit of forgetting all early religious feelings.
D’Orsay seemed hurt at the observation. I then
plainly said to him:—</p>

<p>“‘The fact is, I imagined, or rather I supposed,
you had followed Lady Blessington’s example, if
not in giving up your own religion, in seeming to
conform to another more in vogue in England.’</p>

<p>“D’Orsay rose up with considerable energy,
and stood erect and firm with obvious exertion for
a few seconds, looking like himself again, and
pointing to the head of the bed, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Do you see those two swords?’ pointing to
two small swords (which were hung over the
crucifix crosswise); ‘do you see that sword to the
right? With that sword I fought in defence of
my religion.’”</p>

<p>He then briefly narrated the story of the duel
which we have already told.</p>

<p>During his last illness, D’Orsay received from
the Emperor the appointment of Director of Fine
Arts. The honour came too late.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning of the fourth
of August 1852, aged fifty-one, died Alfred, Count
d’Orsay, the last and the greatest of the dandies.</p>

<p>He was buried at Chambourcy; the same
monument covers his ashes and those of Lady
Blessington. In the absence of the Duke de
Grammont, who was confined to bed by illness,
D’Orsay’s nephews, Count Alfred de Grammont
and the Duke de Lespare, were the chief mourners;
the Duchesse de Grammont, his sister, was there,
and among others Prince Napoleon, Count de
Montaubon, M. Emile de Girardin, M. Charles
Lafitte, M. Alexandre Dumas fils, Mr Hughes
Ball, and several other Englishmen.</p>

<p>Gronow says: “His death produced, both in
London and Paris, a deep and universal regret.”</p>

<p>But one who did not love him, Count Horace
de Viel Castel, whom we have before quoted, did
not join in the chorus of regrets:—</p>

<p>“Count d’Orsay is dead, and all the papers
are mourning his loss. He leaves behind him
they say, many <i lang="fr">chefs-d’œuvres</i>, and on his death-bed
requested Clésinger to finish his bust of
Prince Jérôme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“D’Orsay had no talent; his statuettes are
detestable and his busts very bad; but a certain
set cried him up for their own purposes, and called
him a great man. One newspaper goes so far as
to affirm that on hearing of his death the President
said: ‘I have lost my best friend,’ a statement
which I know to be perfectly false.</p>

<p>“D’Orsay’s friends were the President’s
enemies—the Jérôme Bonapartes, Emile de
Girardin, Lamartine, etc. He never pardoned
the Prince for not appointing him Ambassador to
the Court of St James’, forgetting, or purposely
ignoring, the fact that such a thing was impossible.
No Government would have received him. His
debts are fabulous.… The papers inform us
that he has been buried at Chambourcy (on the
property of his sister, the Duchesse de Grammont)
in the same grave as his mother-in-law, Lady
Blessington. The incident is sublime; to make
it complete, perhaps they will engrave on his
tombstone: ‘That his inconsolable and heart-broken
widow, etc. etc.’</p>

<p>“He died ten years too late, for he became at
last merely a ridiculous old doll. The President
does not lose his best friend; on the contrary, he
is well rid of, a compromising schemer.”</p>

<p>Clésinger one day asked D’Orsay why he did
not come to see him oftener.</p>

<p>“Because people say that it is I who make
your statues,” responded D’Orsay, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Really!” replied the sculptor, “I will come

guilty of <em>yours</em>.”</p>

<p>Dickens wrote in <cite>Household Words</cite>: “Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
d’Orsay, whose name is publicly synonymous with
elegant and graceful accomplishments; and who,
by those who knew him well, is affectionately
remembered and regretted, as a man whose great
abilities might have raised him to any distinction,
and whose gentle heart even a world of fashion
left unspoiled.”</p>

<p>Landor writes:—</p>

<p>“The death of poor, dear D’Orsay fell heavily
tho’ not unexpectedly upon me. Intelligence
of his painful and hopeless malady reached me
some weeks before the event. With many
foibles and grave faults, he was generous and
sincere. Neither spirits nor wit ever failed
him, and he was ready at all times to lay down
his life for a friend. I felt a consolation in
the loss of Lady Blessington in the thought
how unhappy she would have been had she
survived him. The world will never more see
united such graceful minds, so much genius and
pleasantry, as I have met, year after year, under
her roof.…”</p>

<p>Macready:—</p>

<p>“To my deep grief perceived the notice of the
death of dear Count d’Orsay. No one who knew
him and had affections could help loving him.
When he liked he was most fascinating and
captivating. It was impossible to be insensible
to his graceful, frank, and most affectionate
manner.… He was the most brilliant, graceful,
endearing man I ever saw—humorous, witty, and
clear-headed.”</p>

<p>D’Orsay’s good friend, Emile de Girardin,
wrote in <cite lang="fr">La Presse</cite> of August 5th, 1852:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Le Comte d’Orsay est mort ce matin à trois
heures.</p>

<p>“La douleur et le vide de cette mort seront
vivement ressentis par tous les amis qu’il comptait
en si grand nombre en France et en Angleterre,
dans tous les rangs de la société, et sous tous les
drapeaux de la politique.</p>

<p>“A Londres, les salons de Gore House furent
toujours ouverts à tous les proscrits politiques,
qu’ils s’appelassent Louis Bonaparte ou Louis
Blanc, à tous les naufragés de la fortune et
à toutes les illustrations de l’art et de la
science.</p>

<p>“A Paris, il n’avait qu’un vaste atelier, mais
quiconque allait frapper au nom d’un malheur
à secourir ou d’un progrès à encourager, était
toujours assuré du plus affable accueil et du plus
cordial concours.</p>

<p>“Avant le 2 Décembre, nul ne fit d’efforts
plus réitérés pour que la politique suivît un autre
cours et s’élevât aux plus hautes aspirations.</p>

<p>“Après le 2 Décembre, nul ne s’employa plus
activement pour amortir les coups de la proscription:
Pierre Dupont<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> le sait et peut le certifier.</p>

<p>“Le Président de la République n’avait pas
d’ami à la fois plus dévoué et plus sincère que le
Comte d’Orsay; et c’est quand il venait de la
rapprocher de lui par le titre et les fonctions de
surintendant des beaux-arts qu’il le perd pour
toujours.</p>

<p>“C’est une perte irréparable pour l’art et pour
les artistes, mais c’est une perte plus irréparable
encore pour la Vérité et pour le Président de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
République, car les palais n’ont que deux portes
ouvertes à la Vérité: la porte de l’amitié et la
porte de l’adversité, de l’amitié qui est à l’adversité
ce que l’éclair est à la foudre.</p>

<p>“La justice indivisible, la justice égale pour
tous, la justice dont la mort tient les balances,
compte les jours quand elle ne mesure pas les
dons. Alfred d’Orsay avait été comblé de trop
de dons—grand cœur, esprit, un goût pur, beauté
antique, force athlétique, adresse incomparable à
tous les exercises du corps, aptitude incontestâble
à tous les arts auxquels il s’était adonné;
dessin, peinture, sculpture—Alfred d’Orsay avait
été comblé de trop de dons pour que ses jours ne
fussent pas parcimonieusement comptés. La
mort a été inexorable, mais elle a été juste. Elle
ne l’a pas traité en homme vulgaire. Elle ne l’a
pas pris, elle l’a choisi.”</p>

<p>There is one more general summary of his
character which must be given. Grantley
Berkeley tells a pleasant story of a dinner at
the Old Ship Hotel at Greenwich:—</p>

<p>“I remember a dinner at the Ship, where
there were a good many ladies, and where D’Orsay
was of the party, during which his attention was
directed to a centre pane of glass in the bay-window
over the Thames, where some one had
written, in large letters, with a diamond, D’Orsay’s
name in improper conjunction with a celebrated
German <i lang="fr">danseuse</i> then fulfilling an engagement
at the Opera. With characteristic readiness and
<i lang="fr">sang-froid</i>, he took an orange from a dish near
him, and, making some trifling remark on the
excellence of the fruit, tossed it up once or twice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
catching it in his hand again. Presently, as if
by accident, he gave it a wider cant, and sent it
through the window, knocking the offensive
words out of sight into the Thames.”</p>

<p>Then he continues:—</p>

<p>“D’Orsay was as clever and agreeable a companion
as any in the world, and perhaps as inventive
and extravagant in dress as Beau
Brummel, though not so original nor so varied in
the grades of costume through which his imagination
carried him. There were all sorts of hats
and garments named after him by their makers,
more or less like those he wore, and a good many
men copied him to some extent in his attire. He
and I adopted the tight wristbands, turned back
upon the sleeve of the coat upon the wrist, in
which fashion we were not followed by others, I
am happy to say.…</p>

<p>“Among the peculiarities and accomplishments
for which D’Orsay desired to be famous was that
of great muscular strength, as well as a knowledge
of all weapons, and when he shook hands with
his friends it was with the whole palm, with such
an impressive clutch of the fingers as drove the
blood from the limb he held, and sent every ring
on the hand almost to the bone. The apparent
frankness of manner and kind expression in his
good-looking face, when he met you with the
exclamation, ‘<i lang="fr">Ah, ha, mon ami!</i>’ and grasped
you by the hand, were charming, and we, who
rather prided ourselves on being able to do strong
things, used to be ready for this grasp, and
exhibit our muscular powers in return. There is
no man who can so well imitate D’Orsay’s method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of greeting in this particular as my excellent
friend, Dr Quin.</p>

<p>“Poor dear D’Orsay! He was a very accomplished,
kind-hearted, and graceful fellow, and
much in request in what may be called the
fashionable world. I knew him well in his
happier hours, I knew him when he was in
difficulties, and I knew him in distress; and when
in France I heard from Frenchmen that those in
his native country to whom he looked for high
lucrative employment and patronage, and from
whom D’Orsay thought he had some claim to expect
them, rather slighted his pretensions; and
when in his last, lingering, painful illness,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> left
him to die too much neglected and alone.</p>

<p>“That D’Orsay was unwisely extravagant as
well as not over-scrupulous in morality, we know;
but that is a man’s own affair, not that of his
friends. His faults, whatever they were, were
covered, or at least glossed over by real kindness
of heart, great generosity, and prompt good-nature,
grace in manner, accomplishments, and
high courage; therefore, place him side by side
with many of the men with whom he lived in
England, D’Orsay by comparison would have the
advantage in many things.”</p>

<h2 id="XXX">XXX<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT WAS HE?</span></h2>

<p>Witnesses have been heard for the defence
and for the prosecution; the defendant himself
has been examined and cross-examined; what is
the verdict?</p>

<p>Lamb has told us that we must not take the
immoral comedies of the Restoration seriously.
His argument does not bear precisely upon the
case in point, but it is of assistance. Lamb,
speaking of plays, whereas we are writing of
history, says: “We have been spoiled with—not
sentimental comedy—but a tyrant far more pernicious
to our pleasures which has succeeded to it,
the exclusive and all-devouring drama of common
life.” For “comedy” substitute “history”; for
“drama” put “psychology” and we can fit our
text to our sermon, a thing often more easy to
achieve than to fit one’s sermon to one’s text.
We had been surfeited with sentimental history,
with the white-washing of sinners and the super-humanising
of saints; we therefore turned to
what we are pleased to call real life, and taking
everything seriously have made everything dull.</p>

<p>Let us return to our Lamb for a moment:—</p>

<p>“I confess for myself that (with no great delinquencies
to answer for) I am glad for a season
to take an airing beyond the diocese of the strict
conscience—not to live always in the precincts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the law-courts—but now and then, for a dream-while
or so, to imagine a world with no meddling
restrictions—to get into recesses, whither the
hunter cannot follow me—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘⸺ Secret shades</div>
<div class="verse">Of woody Ida’s inmost grave,</div>
<div class="verse">While yet there was no fear of Jove.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I come back to my cage and my restraint the
fresher and more healthy for it.”</p>

<p>That is the point of view we must take if we
are to judge D’Orsay justly; we must lock up our
conscience for the nonce, we must get away from
the unimaginative atmosphere of the law-courts,
we must snap the shackles of convention which
always make it impossible for us to form a fair
opinion of the unconventional.</p>

<p>Judged by the standards of life and conduct
which must control everyday men and women,
D’Orsay was a monster of iniquity, and also, as
<cite>Punch</cite> would put it, he was worse than wicked,
he was vulgar. His friends cannot have weighed
him by any such standards, or they would have
condemned him and scorned him. They could
not then have accepted him as one of themselves,
as a man to be almost loved; they would have
turned cold shoulders to any ordinary mortal who
treated the love of woman as a comedy and debts
of honour as mere farce.</p>

<p>But your real dandy is not an ordinary man
and must not be judged by common standards.
He stands outside and above the ordinary rules
of life and conduct; he has not any conscience,
and questions of morality do not affect him.
All that is for us to do in viewing such a one as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
D’Orsay is to weigh his physical and mental gifts,
and to examine the uses to which he put them,
to look to the opportunities which were given to
him and the advantage which he took of them.</p>

<p>Of the multitude of witnesses whom we have
summoned there is not one who denies that D’Orsay
was a man of supreme physical beauty, and the
portraits of him support their verdict. Good looks
that were almost effeminate in their charm were
supported by the physique of a perfect man, and in
all manly sports and pursuits he was highly accomplished.
Of his mental qualities it is not so
easy justly to weigh the worth; he was an accomplished
amateur in art some say, others deny
it, but on the whole the evidence seems to be in
his favour; he was endowed with a pleasing habit
of talk, though scarcely with wit. He was good-humoured,
a <i lang="fr">bon garçon</i> and good-natured. He
was an accomplished <i lang="fr">gourmet</i>. In the art of
dress he was supreme. He was more greatly
skilled, perhaps, than any other man, in the art
of gaining and giving pleasure. He was brave.</p>

<p>Morality, as has been said, does not enter into
the consideration of such a man; he was above
morality, or outside it. There have been and
there are others like him. They are grown-up
children, utterly irresponsible; not immoral but
unmoral; they “please to live and live to please”
themselves. They do not realise that their actions
may prove costly to others and therefore do not
count the cost. They are children of impulse not
of calculation. They are emotional not logical.
Pleasure is their pursuit and they shun all that is
unpleasing and displeasing. They are so different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
from us ordinary folk that we cannot appraise them
or even fully understand them. Fear of consequences
that would appal us have no terrors for
them; they do not need to set them aside, they
are not aware of them. Conventions which
hamper us, for them do not exist. To fulfil the
desire of to-day is their one aim and ambition and
they take no heed of to-morrow.</p>

<p>It is as a dandy that D’Orsay must be judged,
and in that <i lang="fr">rôle</i> he achieved triumph. It was as a
dandy he lived and as a dandy that he is immortal.
Such men as he, if indeed there are others with his
genius, should—as we have said—be pensioned by
the State, should be set above the carking cares of
questions of want of pounds—shillings and pence
do not trouble them; they should be cherished
and sustained as rarely-gifted and rare beings, to
whom life presents not any serious problems, and to
whom life is a space of time only too brief for all
the pleasures which should be crowded into it.
“Life’s fitful fever” should be kept apart from
such sunny souls, and our only regret should be
that there are so few of them.</p>

<p>There are mouldy-minded people who put
out the finger of scorn at D’Orsay. Is it not the
truth that they are jealous of him, and that at
the bottom of their hearts there is a muttered
prayer: “I would thank God if He <em>had</em> made <em>me</em>
such a man”?</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
